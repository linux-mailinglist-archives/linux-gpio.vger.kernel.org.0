While I technically might agree with you, this was working for everybody
since day 1 of support of Intel Merrifield added (circa v4.8), now _user
space_ is broken.

Note, I'm having _simple_ setup, no fancy UDEV or DBUS there, and I want
my scripts simply continue working. As I mentioned, this is Buildroot
+ Busybox which I haven't touched in the area of how they treat MMC
devices in _user space_.

Since we are at rc6 I prefer to get this reverted first and next cycle we can
discuss better solutions. I'm all for testing any.

And Rob, AFAIU, is against aliases.

No, and why should we?
