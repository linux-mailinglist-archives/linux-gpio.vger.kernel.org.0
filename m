Ouch. But luckily there is no crime in the tables per se as I have told before.
Should be fixed in the kernel without any firmware updates / fixes involved.

Okay, you need to use GpioInt() properly.
See cover letter: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-acpi/20210816115953.72533-1-andriy.shevchenko@linux.intel.com/T/#u

Consider to handle this in GPIO driver and you won't need the headache in the
consumer drivers. Hardware is fine in this design (as far as I now got it).

The acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get() call can get Linux vIRQ for you same way you have got it for Interrupt() resources via platform_get_irq().
