Oh, yes, our processes are completely non-ideal. Once I tried to micro-optimize
the way of Cc'ing people for the patches to avoid waste of resources and you
know what? This is a dead end. I gave up, so I don't care anymore and don't
buy this argument anymore. If people are serious about this, they should be
serious consistently.

"For urgent regressions, consider asking Linus to pick up the fix straight from
the mailing list: he is totally fine with that for uncontroversial fixes.
Ideally though such requests should happen in accordance with the subsystem
maintainers or come directly from them."

The first thing I'm not so comfortable with is that Bart as a subsystem
maintainer will be by-passed. The second one, is the metrics of urgency.
I can assume that something from a TIP tree is really urgent and they
even have established fast track for ages. But why do you think this fix
is of the same level of urgency? I haven't found in the documentation
the checklist which I can count numbers, compare with a table and have
a clear answer "yes, I have do it".
