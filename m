I have started to look into jz4780 HDMI setup again.

Well, there is no driver compatible to "ingenic,jz4780-lcd" so far
and it is questionalbe if we need a different one.

I think we should rather make the driver also compatible
than adding a fallback to ingenic,jz4740-lcdto the DTS.

The reason why this is better even if both LCDC are almost
compatible is that the jz4780 allows for much bigger displays
and therefore should have its own jz_soc_info with 4k x 2k
as maximum.

Next I tried to find out if the LCDC are really compatible.

Well the jz4780 has two lcdc instances but they are separated
by the reg addr. Next, there are unique features (like picture in
picture with alpha blending) but those are probably disabled
if not programmed from reset state. This may become a reason
to separate or augment the driver for the jz4780 but at the
moment we can ignore that.

There are also subtly different bit definitions and register
widths (e.g. 24 bit in addition to 16/18 bit modes or more bits
for the sync position) but it looks as if the ingenic_drm
driver already handles this.

Then I tried to read back the registers. Strangely they
are all 0x00000000. So there is no programming of the
lcd-controller in our DT setup with HDMI at all!

I also checked that ingenic_drm_probe() is called and
returns successfully 0. It also reports that a /dev/fb
has been created:

[    7.908830] ingenic-drm 13050000.lcd-controller: fb0: ingenic-drmdrmf =
frame buffer device

But for example ingenic_drm_encoder_atomic_mode_set() is
never called which should write some registers of the LCDC.

I only did see some calls to ingenic_drm_encoder_atomic_check().

This of course explains why we have no HDMI signals despite
proper HPD and a /dev/fb0. Because the LCDC is not being
programmed.

Any ideas / hints how to check or improve?

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
