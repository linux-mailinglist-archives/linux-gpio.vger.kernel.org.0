Yes, currently we have implemented like your description,
Each deivce shoud get both PHYs, DP PHY for <... 1> and USB PHY for <... 0>.

For coexistence process:

When we start implement DP part, usb driver team said only need config TCSR phy mode and orientation during switch in USB-C port.
Based on your previous comments avout SW_PWRDN, I'm confirming with the USB team whether SW_REST/SWPWRDN/START_CTRL registers might affect DP.

Anyway, even though the original SoC design supports DP or USB over Type-Cï¼Œ
but on QCS615 ADP AIR platform, there are only four USB-A port which works with 'qcs615-qmp-usb3-phy' driver, and no USB-C port.
DP port is mappped from usb pin to the video out sub-board.
so we are unable to verify the switching case between DP and USB devices under USB-C.

However, I'm also confirming whether anything other will affect USB and DP each other.
