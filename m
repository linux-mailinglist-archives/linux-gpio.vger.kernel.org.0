If you think this fixes an issue back to 3.x, then just leave it at
that, there's no need to have to test all of these.  If when I apply the
patch to the stable trees, and it does not go back to all of the
active versions specified by Fixes: then you will get an email saying
so and can handle it then if you want to.

That will just mean more work for both of us, leave it as is, just drop
the "# 6.1.x" portion please.

Yes, that would be good, thank you.

Yes please.
