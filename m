Hi Krzysztof & Conor,

I'm sorry for the confusion caused to you, such as 2k2000, which has two
gpio controllers with different register offsets.  The gpio node is
following:

         pioA: gpio0@0x1fe00500 {
             compatible = "loongson,ls2k-gpio";
             reg = <0 0x1fe00500 0 0x20>;
             gpio-controller;
             #gpio-cells = <2>;
             ngpios = <32>;
             loongson,gpio-ctrl-mode = <0>;
             loongson,gpio-conf-offset = <0>;
             loongson,gpio-in-offset = <0xc>;
             loongson,gpio-out-offset = <0x8>;
         };

         pioB: gpio1@0x100e0000 {
             compatible = "loongson,ls2k-gpio";
             reg = <0 0x100e0000 0 0x20>;
             gpio-controller;
             #gpio-cells = <2>;
             ngpios = <64>;
             loongson,gpio-ctrl-mode = <0>;
             loongson,gpio-conf-offset = <0>;
             loongson,gpio-in-offset = <0x20>;
             loongson,gpio-out-offset = <0x10>;
         };


In addition, the GPIO controllers between different SoCs are compatible
except for offset, previously, the examples of 3a5000 and 2k0500 gpio
were listed, Of course, it also includes 2k1000, which gpio chip was
compatible but offset was different.

About the "loongson,ls2k-foo" compatible strings were a mistake that I
got it and I will add a specific SoC  "loongson,ls2k1000-foo" compatible
, but from previous community communication, it seems that if different
SoC peripherals are compatible, they can use the same compatible string.

Thanks,
Yinbo
