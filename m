That's expected behaviour.

I don't think this is a good change. We paper over the real issue where
we and callers need to understand what they are looking for.

I am not sure I understand the problem here. All these should have been
addressed already, no?

So, the GPIOLIB should use dev_fwnode(&gdev->dev) inside it, outside it
the GPIO drivers are free to use gc->fwnode as long as they understand
the lifetime of the respective object.
