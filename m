Is this brings us to the issue with IRQ chip name?

The use case in my mind is the following:
1) we have two or more GPIO chips that supports IRQ;
2) the user registers two IRQs of the same (by number) pin on different chips;
3) cat /proc/interrupt will show 'my_gpio_chip XX', where XX is the number.

So, do I understand correct current state of affairs?

If so, we have to fix this to have any kind of ID added to the chip name that
we can map /proc/interrupts output correctly.
