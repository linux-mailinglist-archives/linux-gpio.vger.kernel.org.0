One use case could be selecting PCIe/SATA as appropriate for an M.2
card. Another use case could be allocating lanes to different slots
based on card presence (e.g. 1 card use x4, 2+ cards use x1). I recently
bought a motherboard whose manual says

| PCI_E4 [normally x4] will run x1 speed when installing devices in PCI_E2/
| PCI_E3/ PCI_E5 slot [all x1].
which implies exactly this sort of design.

Well, these are just easy ways to show the oddities in the PCCRs. I
could have made the same points with the various Layerscapes.

T-series SoCs use a different PCCR layout than Layerscape, despite using
the same registers in the rest of the SerDes. The LS1021 also uses this
scheme, so it's not just T-series (but it's close enough). This is why I
had an option for different PCCR configuration functions in earlier
versions of this series, so if someone wanted they could easily add
T-series support.

To restate, there's no systemic organization to the PCCRs. The driver
configuration should reflect this and allow arbitrary mappings.

The idea is to stick all the PCCR stuff in the SoC devicetree, and the
board-level devicetrees just set up the clocks and pick which MACs use
which phys. Have a look at patches 10 and 15 of this series for some
typical board configurations. I think it's pretty simple, since all the
complexity is in the SoC dt.

That said, I originally had the driver set up so that everything was
based on the compatible, but I had to change that because it was nacked
by the devicetree people.

Yeah, but from the perspective of the driver, if we have one phy per
lane we don't get any indication from the subsystem that we are doing a
multi-lane configuration. So we need to stick this sort of thing into
the phy handle. But IMO we can do all this in the driver and the board
integrator never has to worry about it.

Well, this is why they are condensed into a "lane group". From the MAC's
perspective the whole thing is opaque, and gets handled by the phy
subsystem.

Well, FWIW those serdes don't need good coordination. That said, I
think it might be interesting to have some subsystem-level support for
this, much like clock groups.

Well, I think we should take the opportunity to think about the hardware
which exists and how we plan to model it. IMO grouping lanes into a
single phy simplifies both the phy driver and the mac driver.
