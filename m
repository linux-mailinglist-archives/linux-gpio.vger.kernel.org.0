...a maybe dumb question from my side, BUT does the SCMI Pinctrl carry
enough information as it stands for the driver to derive autonomously
and efficently the possible/applicable gpio ranges ?

Are they (GPIOs) all the remaining unassociated pins ?
If this is the case note that the SCMI Pinctrl lets you query the
associations in groups or functions and this is generally now done
only lazily on-demand when specific pins/groups/funcs are requested
by the parsed DT confs: IOW, in order to derive GPIOs from the set
of unassociated ones, you will have to at first add some new full-lookup
pinctrl_ops to query upfront all existing associations (avoiding, at will,
the lazy querying adopted now) and then singling-out the non-associated
ones from the lists of all possible group/funcs associations.

Moreover, should we allow anyway the optional possibility to forcibly
restrict the available gpios from the DT, or we can just assume that
those un-available (map out as above) wont just be exposed by the
SCMI server ?

..again sorry if I am missing something crucial here and just talking
non-sense but I have limited familiarity with Pinctrl/GPIOs usage.

Thanks
Cristian
