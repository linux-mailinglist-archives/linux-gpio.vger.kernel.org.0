It's impossible. bitmap_remap() is universal, these APIs only for the specific
domain.

It's added in this patch in the format of kernel doc.

I'll look into it again, maybe dst would work as well, I don't remember why
I have chosen mask. Maybe because it's invariant here, dunno.

OK. No purpose there. Perhaps it's a leftover from the first experiments
on the implementation of these APIs.

Somebody is better at hex, somebody at binary one, I would leave both.

It looks like you stopped reading documentation somewhere on the middle.
The two APIs are documented with the same example which makes it clear
that they are data-loss transformations.

Do you need something like this to be added (in both documentations):

  The bitmap_scatter(), when executed over the @dst bitmap, will
  restore the @src one if the @mask is kept the same, see the example
  in the function description.

?

No, you are not.

I can move them into header.

Sure. But it's not related to the patch. It will test bitmap_weight() and not
the new APIs, so, whatever is bigger 64 will suffice the purpose and won't
anyhow affect the newly added APIs.

...

Do you have a code in mind? I can incorporate it.

Again, you should understand that it's only applicable to the certain cases,
otherwise it makes no sense (it's like comparing performance of ffs() on
a single word against find_first_bit() on the arbitrary amount of words).
