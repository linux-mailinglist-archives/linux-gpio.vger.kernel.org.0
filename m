sure, I will send a new one later, but let me answer your question first.

Yes, I have some question before.


There are some similar discussion here,Â  please take a look, Song baohua 
explained it more professionally.

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/e949a474a9284ac6951813bfc8b34945@hisilicon.com/


Here are some excerpts from the discussion:


I think the code disabling irq in hardIRQ is simply wrong.
Since this commit
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e58aa3d2d0cc
genirq: Run irq handlers with interrupts disabled

interrupt handlers are definitely running in a irq-disabled context
unless irq handlers enable them explicitly in the handler to permit
other interrupts.


Thanks

Jiaxing
