I understand, and it is frustrating. If such case happens the solution
in upstream is not sending the same NAKed version but send something else.

Here:
"I proposed to duplicate the entries. Do you keep QUP nodes in DTSI and
customize per address? No."

Dmitry responded that having PMICs extracted help re-using. He is right.
But here you hit the limit of such re-usage.
