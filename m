To be fair, I added them to Cc:. For the new readers: The diff I
suggested looks as follows (probably whitespace broken as I cut-n-pasted):

How would this alternate approach look like? Something like:

	gpio-controler@123450 {
		compatible = "..";
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;

		init = "", "output-high", "", "input", "", "", "output-low";
	};

? Compared to the solution I suggested (and hogs) this differs as you cannot
pass flags like GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW.

(Sidenode: As

	mygpio {
		gpio-hog;
		gpios = <5 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		output-low;
	};

makes AFAIK the output high it would be less surprising if the binding
supported "output-active" and "output-inactive".)

Best regards
Uwe
