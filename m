This is why I think it makes the most sense to describe the initial I/O 
domain voltage as a property of the I/O domain, since that is most 
truthful to what is actually needed to initialise the hardware. Ideally 
we could then just use that initial configuration to probe successfully, 
and use a notifier to pick up the regulator if and when it does appear 
later (on the basis that the voltage should not be able to change 
*without* one). And otherwise if an initial voltage isn't specified then 
we can assume it's OK to wait for the regulator and query it as normal.

Hopefully that would just be a sensible non-cyclic design that avoids 
this problem altogether. However there's nothing special about PMICs, 
this could equally apply if the I/O domain was supplied by a GPIO 
regulator or PWM regulator which used one of its own pins; the 
fundamental problem to solve is being able to determine the correct 
initial voltage setting for an I/O domain without having to perform any 
I/O via that domain itself. That is the physical dependency cycle which 
can exist here, regardless of how we address any other software 
dependencies between drivers within Linux.
