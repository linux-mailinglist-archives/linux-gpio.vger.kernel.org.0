Hmm, I'll bet it's EPROBE_DEFER related.

The original call (pre that commit) of pinctrl_gpio_direction_output() checks
if the pin controller could find the pin (pinctrl_get_device_gpio_range()).

That doesn't happen in the new code.

The sunxi appears to have two pincontrollers in the device tree (&pio and &r_pio),
that might be part of the reason this is an issue here.

Linus, should there be a check somewhere for a missing pincontroller in
gpiod_get_index()? I suspect that before my commit it was the gpiod_configure_flags
call in that function that returned -EPROBE_DEFER, but I'm not completely certain.

If someone can give me a hint about what should be done, then I can make a patch.

The alternative is to revert this sunxi patch, but perhaps this is a deeper
problem with these pincontroller drivers that set the direction directly
instead of going through pinctrl_gpio_direction_output().

Corentin, it would help me if you can figure out where the EPROBE_DEFER is
returned (pre-commit) in drivers/pinctrl/core.c. Probably pinctrl_get_device_gpio_range().

And I'd love to have the WARN_ON(1) output from just before the 'return -EPROBE_DEFER'.

	Hans
