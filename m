That's whole idea behind swnodes. They (ideally) should be created _before_
any other object they are being used with. This is how it works today.

And doing swnode->dev = ... contradicts a lot: layering, lifetime objects, etc.

No. This is a mistaken assumption.

Fine, but do not use dev pointer from fwnode, esp. software node.
