Oh, that's a lot of fixing ahead! But if you send anything to test, I would
happy do it.

I believe it's not feasible, see below why.

I don't think this is working solution.

My case is: I have build an environment with a script that has hardcoded
mmcblk0 to mount from. When I run this script I do not know _which_ exact
board I run on, it should work on any of them (same boards, but different
UUIDs).

While writing this I realised that the common denominator I have here is
the physical device (as it's a PCI one), and it's on-SoC, so can't change
its BDF. So, there seem to be a solution. Let me try to implement that.
