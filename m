Indeed, and I understand that, but in any case it wont be required for
both the generic pinconf and the IMX way to coexist and live together on
the same system/platform at runtime, right ?

So, I was thinking as an alternative, while still building all
(generic+IMX) in defconfig, wouldn't be possible to detect at runtime in the
pinctrl-scmi probe() which is the type of binding used in the DT (i.e.
generic VS imx), before registering with the core Pinctrl subsystem, and so
act accordingly parsing and providing different callbacks based on that ?

I mean, without any compatible addition, just looking up the protocol@19
node content @probe and switch to iMX callbacks if the fsl,pins binding
is found ?

Not sure is this is totally viable, nor clean or that it is not less horrific
from the Pinctrl_subsystem/DT point of view for Linus ... just an idea to think
about or discard.

I dont think there is really any chance to upstream a vendor protocol that
is a bare copy of a standard protocol just to workaround this...and if
this is going to be the end-result you can just keep your current 2
small 'IMX custom-compatible' patches downstream.

This wont be a problem once the RFC[1] I posted last week is in...unless
someone objects, you will have to identify your vendor protocol module
at build time ALSO with the vendor/sub_vendor ID string exposed by your fw...
...so each vendor will effectively have the full vendor protocol space
number at their disposal.

Indeed this week, I hope to review your series about custom protocols
and the qualcomm ones and ask both for feedback on [1] and then to
rework those series on some non-RFC similar to 1 that I will post
afterwards.

Thanks,
Cristian
