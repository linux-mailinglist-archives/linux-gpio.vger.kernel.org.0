I mean that there are similar functionality in different tools and for
one purpose you need one, for another another and there is no format
file convertors available (as far as my shallow googling shows).

Ah, okay, then choose the one you think fits most.

No strong opinion, I don't know the Sigrok tool and its file format,
so I can't tell if it makes sense or doesn't.

I'm a bit lost in the context here, but the ' > /dev/null 2>&1' means
to redirect stdout to the /dev/null followed by redirecting stderr to
stdout (which is redirected to /dev/null). The other construction
might have side effects IIRC.

The SO talks about _bash_, your script is a plain Shell one, right?
And for the record, I don't like bashisms in some generic code, like
the one we use with Linux kernel.

To clean up the garbage it may leave in case of the interrupted run, no?

The difference is on how the  "foo bar" (with double quotes!) will be
represented. In your case it will be translated as "foo" and "bar", in
the case I'm saying it will be "foo bar".
