Not at all, the aim was exactly the opposite, avoiding that some protocol
could have been written without all the needed includes: since a basic set
of headers is definitely common to any protocol you may think to write,
grouping all there was meant to avoid this...I thought that by moving the
problem away in one single internal common header was easier to monitor.

I certainly maybe wrong, but I dont see how you can deduce I dont care...

...and maybe, only maybe, what that 95% of people is trying to do in their
horrible code is to deliver the best reasonably possible thing within their
timeline while you are barking at them in chase of never to be released utter
perfection.

Well, no, but is it not a repetitive and error-prone process ?
Is it not the exact reason why devres management exist in first place, to avoid
repetitive manual alloc/free of resources and related pitfalls ? (even though
certainly it is normally used in a more conventional and straightforward way)

The idea was to give some sort of aid in the SCMI stack for writing protocols,
so regarding mem_mgmt, I just built on top of devres facilities, not invented
anything, to try to avoid repetitions and let the core handle mem allocs/free
during the probe phases as much as possible: in pinctrl case would be
particularly trivial to instead manually allocate stuff at init (due to many
lazy delayed allocations) but other protocols need a lot more to be done at init,
frequently in a loop to allocate multiple resources descriptors, and manually
undoing all of that on each error-path and on cleanup is definitely error-prone
and a pain.

Last but not least, this whole thing was designed to address the needs of the
protocols that existed at that time....it is only now with pinctrl lazy-allocations
at runtime that the ugly cohexistence of devm_ and non-devm allocations became a
thing....so clearly the thing needs to be improved/rethinked...even dropped if no
more fitting...

... or alternatively since devres allocations are anyway optional, you could just
use regular kmalloc/kfree for this protocol and avoid this dual handling...

...this was just to put things in context...and I'll happily let Sudeep decide
what he prefers in the immediate for pinctrl or more in general about all the
scmi devres, that I've got enough of these pleasant interactions for now...

Thanks,
Cristian
