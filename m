Thanks for all the pointers.  It looks to me that it's the same problem
- the GPIO number in ACPI table is broken and needs an override from
kernel.  So I think what we need is a generic solution to a problem
not uncommon.  Rather than asking all different drivers to resolve the
same problem all over the kernel, I believe GPIO ACPI library is just
the right place.

Looking at your platform and problem, I realise that to be a generic
solution, my patch needs an additional device identification matching,
as one GPIO number that is broken for one device could be correct for
another.  I will improve it, so that your problem can be resolved by
simply adding a new entry to acpi_gpio_pin_override_table[].
