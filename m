Yes, I know. And I fully support the goal.

But I personally do not have the time to learn the (IMHO brain-twisting)
way the Schema format is working. Especially, I am not interested
in becoming volunteer translator for .txt based schemas developed
by someone else.

So I hope that someone from the community can and is willing to do
that.

Or that there will appear good tools soon. E.g. some GUI
based editor tool would be very helpful so that you don't have
to fight with the yaml indentation rules. Like there are XML
and DTD editors. And even HTML is rarely written manually any more.

IMHO such tools should have been developed and in place *before*
the rule to provide DT schemata is enforced.

Anyways, I have requested for comments (and did expect this one).

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
