Ok so just checked in theory and verified in practice: with an irq
request orthogonal to the GPIO descriptor, when the GPIO device goes
down, it destroys the irq domain (side note: gpio-sim now finally
disposes of all existing mappings too which would have been the source
of an error here). When the user calls free_irq(), the underlying
irq_do_desc() calls mtree_load() which now returns NULL (mapping is
gone) and nothing happens.

This change doesn't change that behavior - you can still unbind the
GPIO device at any moment and the irq user will be fine.

The problem is: I can no longer reproduce the crash I saw in KASAN
with current next and I'm thinking I may have mistaken one of the bugs
I recently fixed for the culprit here. What I'm seeing now when a
module is unloaded is: driver gets unregistered, device gets unbound
and that's it, all works fine. So this patch and the libgpiod one may
have been pointless noise. :(

Taking the module reference only when there's a requested descriptor
is in line with what most other frameworks do as well.

I need more coffee but maybe at this point I should switch to
panzerschokolade...
