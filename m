While right now, to my knowledge, there is no users of the duty cycle
control, I'm adding a generic driver that uses it in another series [1]
with an intention to use it across multiple qcom based devices.

While making it I spent quite a bit of time staring at the oscilloscope
to figure out that I need changes from patch 4/4 of this series and I'd
like to make this quirk a bit more obvious to others.

I intend this WARN or error to be hit by a person bringing up something
new, user should never see it. For example a possible story could be:

- Backlight control is connected to the clock on device X
- Developer adds (future) pwm-clk adapter and pwm-backlight to the DT
- Backlight slider in UI doesn't work anyway. (don't think UIs show
  errors here)
- Developer troubleshoots the thing and either finds WARN in dmesg
  or that the sysfs write errors out.

In my experience, people bringing devices up pay a very close attention
to dmesg so I think giving a WARN is fine, but I'm fine with whichever
approach you prefer.
