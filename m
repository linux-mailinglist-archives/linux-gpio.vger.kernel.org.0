Sure, anything you want to work on supporting can be added to the kernel,
the important bit is that it's well written and can be maintained going forward.

My best guess is that we'll end up ripping out all NOMMU support in
a few years, when we get to a point when both of these things happen:

- the number of actual users that still update their kernels becomes
  really low

- There is some treewide refactoring that isn't easily supportable without an
   MMU unless someone puts extra work into it.

At the moment, we still support NOMMU kernels on a bunch of architectures
(Arm, riscv/k210, sh/j2, m68k/coldfire, xtensa and h8300). Out of these,
Arm is by far the most active, and if Arm NOMMU support was to go away
for some reason, the others would likely follow.

I brought that up during the initial review, but I think this is even
less interesting
than Cortex-M support from the perspective of potential use cases. While
Cortex-M MCUs have some advantages over larger SoCs in terms of
power consumption and cost, this is generally not true for running Linux
on Cortex-R. The Cortex-R and Cortex-A cores are closely related, so
they tend have similar power/performance/area characteristics, but
the lack of an MMU makes the Cortex-R much less useful. If there was
an advantage to running with the MMU disabled, you could actually do that
on a Cortex-A as well, but clearly nobody does that either.

Vladimir has put some work into making Cortex-R work in the kernel, and
he may have some other thoughts on this question.
