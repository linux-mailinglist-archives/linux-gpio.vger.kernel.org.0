Because we don't want to return -ENXIO in case of race condition.

It should return -EPROBE_DEFER similar to how we are doing when gc->to_irq
is NULL.

So in this case when both gc->to_irq = NULL and gc->irq.initialized = FALSE,
we will be returning -EPROBE_DEFER. This will make sure that devices 
like touchscreen
do not become fatal due to returning -ENXIO.

Thanks for your comments, I'll make the necessary changes and send a v3.
