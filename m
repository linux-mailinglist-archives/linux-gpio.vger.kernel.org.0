How is emulating the existing sysfs api anything "better"?  It's still
the same api.

I'm saying "Ick" for a userspace mounted filesystem on top of sysfs to
emulate a sysfs api that the kernel provides today.

That's up to you, but again, please do not mount a filesystem there,
that's going to cause nothing but problems in the end (like debugfs and
tracefs and configfs do all the time when people get confused and start
poking around in sysfs code looking for the logic involved in other
places.)
