Hi Arnd, Jesse, All,

About this will you accept support for the other SoCs in the family?
We would like to add in the near future:
- i.MXRT1020(uboot support is already upstreamed)
- i.MXRT1024(almost equal to 1020)
- i.MXRT1060(almost equal to 1050)
- i.MXRT1064(almost equal to 1060)
And
- i.MXRT1160/70 new family with faster core clock(1Ghz) and a cortex M4

We need to add missing lcd(uboot upstreamed), usb(uboot upstreamed), 
ethernet(wip) supports for i.MXRT10xx family.

This is to organize with Jesse also about buying evaluation boards and 
timing.

We’ve meant this porting also as an exercise to deal with Linux deeper 
for us and for the other newbies.

We’ve been also asked about a possible support for s32s(quad cortex-R52) 
on initial emails but it has no mmu too.
While I’m seeing that some cortex-R is landing inside Linux.
Would it be interesting anyway?

Best regards
