Exactly. Somehow, we need to advertise it to the gpiolib code, and
this does the job. I hope to be able to simply drop it once everthing
is converted. One day.

But that's the thing: it almost is a pure 'ops' structure. Only two
things are getting in the way of it:

- the 'parent_dev' field: this is now sorted, as I moved it to the
  irq_domain structure, and updated all the relevant drivers (see what
  is currently in -next).

- the .name field: it really should never be something that changes
  from one instance of the chip to another. Which is why we have the
  .irq_print_chip() method to handle that (and ideally we'd stick to
  pure const names). I'm addressing this as I go, but everything in
  drivers/irqchip/ should be fixed in -next.

The "context" part really lives in irq_domain.
