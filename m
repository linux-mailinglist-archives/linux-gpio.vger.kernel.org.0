Is this reg property always the same value '0x2c'?

Syscons are a slippery slope. It makes it easy to give up abstracting
the 20ish hardware features and makes the resulting drivers which use
the syscon highly platform specific.

Regardless of having a syscon or not, the binding should collapse the
sub-nodes into the olb node. If that requires making a different
compatible for different olb nodes, then that's actually better because
there may be some quirk for one of the olbs and not the other and we
won't be able to fix that without a compatible string update. It would
also make the reg-names property go away, because the sub-functionality
drivers would have the register offsets hard-coded as some offset from
the base of olb, instead of encoding that in DT.

Why isn't i2c speed mode another clk exposed by OLB that rounds to the
different rates?

Sure, don't call platform_ioremap_resource() and friends more than once
per index. But why is the code written in a way that that is happening?
Maybe the driver can ioremap resources, and then register clks for those
resources. I suspect the only way of getting here is that the driver is
focused on registering clks, and ioremapping resources while registering
clks. Don't do that, because then you have to write code to track
resources.

You cannot reorder strings in a DT binding property after the fact.
While the code will keep working if the reg-names elements are
re-ordered, the binding will be backwards incompatible, because the
reg-names property must have the same order. It can be convenient to use
reg-names if you have a long list of reg properties to map, but having
two or one elements isn't a very strong argument.
