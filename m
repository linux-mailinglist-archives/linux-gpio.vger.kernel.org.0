I understand that in your case "firmware" is what DTB provides.
So taking into account that the default of hardware is PU, it needs
a mechanism to override that, correct?

Full duplex sync, i.e. setting flag to PU for the pins that should stay PU:ed
and disabling bias for the ones, that want it to be disabled. (PD accordingly)

Yes, I have got it eventually. The root cause is that after reset you have a
hardware that doesn't disable bias.

Now, we have DT properties for PD and PU, correct?
For each requested pin you decide either to leave the state as it is, or
apply bias.

in ->probe() of your GPIO you reset hardware and for each GPIO descriptor you
set PU flag.
In ->request(), don;t know the name by heart, you disable BIAS based on absence
of flags, it can be done without an additional properties, purely in the GPIO
OF code. Do I understand this correctly?
