I have no idea what else might be lurking out there so I took a broader 
(perhaps overly heavy-handed) approach, but the SPI1 mode bits are the 
only ones I've personally encountered being strapped wrong, so sure, I'd 
be fine with just extending the "hole-punch" a bit to add those bits.  
I'll send a v2 doing that shortly.
