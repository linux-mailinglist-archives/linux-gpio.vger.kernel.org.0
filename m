The move is just unnecessary and not neat. You design DTS based on your
drivers architecture and this is exactly what we want to avoid.

There are 'reg' fields, which is the main problem here. I don't like
that arguments because it entirely misses the discussions - about that
binding or other bindings - happening prior to merge.

No resources here...

And why is it disabled? No external resources. There is no benefit of
this node.
