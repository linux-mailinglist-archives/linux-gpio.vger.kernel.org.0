I don't see how this would work if fwnodes can exist before struct
device is even created. They - after all - represent the actual
physical device hierarchy which may or may not be populated at
run-time depending on many factors.

Once populated, being able to retrieve the software representation of
the device (struct device) from the node from which it was populated
sounds like a reasonable thing to do. What are those problems and are
they even linked to this issue?

I don't care all that much, I can get the device from the children of
the platform device. Still comparing fwnodes, though this time the
other way around.
