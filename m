Not in this patch series as the provider I have dealt with does not such

feature. ts->seq is software counter in that case.

Perhaps I misunderstood "That includes the sw debouncer - more on that

below." comment.

But in this patch series (i.e. HTE provider), they are entangled as hte provider

will only ts the GPIO line which is configured as input irq. That is why I have

separated GPIO line config part and TS part. In other words, let cdev handle

any line config that userspace has asked and let hte handle ts part if the

line config is supported (If line config is not suitable, it will not enable hte, see

gpio-tegra186.c function tegra186_gpio_req_hw_ts() in this patch series where

check happens for the tegra hte provider).

I assumed when this function is called it will "reset" and not  update the configs.

If this assumption is wrong, I will correct the logic here.
