Hi,

This series adds support for the System Management Controller found in
Apple Silicon devices which we model as a mfd. It also includes support
for the GPIO block and the power/reset block as sub-devices.

Changes between v6 and v7:
  - Rebased on 6.16-rc1
  - Dropped mfd- prefix from the macsmc driver name
  - Removed the check if the MBSE key exists in the reboot driver since
    we can rely on the device tree now
  - Changed my mail address to kernel.org

Changes between v5 and v6:
  - Actually reorder struct members this time, start comments with an
    uppercase letter, and use devm_ for mfd_register_devices instead of
    dropping those fixup commits by accident
  - Stefan's comment: Renamed ret to bfr in the reboot driver
  - Sebastian's comments on the reboot driver:
    - Moved Kconfig dependencies to MFD device and made reboot only
      depend on that one
    - Removed sysfs file to configure "reboot after power loss" for now
      since this probably belongs in a userspace tool that directly
      writes to nvmem instead
    - Dropped setting pdev->dev.of_node since that's already done
      automatically and adjusted #include to linux/mod_devicetable.h
    - Dropped MODULE_ALIAS which was probably a leftover from a previous
      version that did not use of_match_table
  - Rob's comments to the dt-bindings
    - Removed examples from sub-devices and added them to the main smc
      binding
    - Removed a spurious |

Changes between v4 and v5:
  - Alyssa's comments:
    - Made the WARN_ON in the reboot driver more obvious
    - Added missing brackets around a for loop in the reboot driver
    - Used min instead of open-coded variant inside the gpio driver
    - Reoder struct memebers to prevent padding inside the mfd driver
  - Lee's comments:
    - All comments now start with an uppercase letter
    - Removed apple_smc_read_ioft_scaled and apple_smc_read_f32_scaled
      since these are not yet used and likely don't belong into
      drivers/mfd
    - Relaced if (ret != 0) with if (ret) when possible
    - Used devm_platform_get_and_ioremap_resource to get and map the
      SRAM resource
    - Used reverse Christmas-tree formating when declaring variables
    - Dropped _platform left-overs from probe and remove functions
    - Removed dev_dbg prints which are no long required after
      development
    - Reworked is_alive/is_initialized so that it's obvious how errors
      during boot are propagated from the callback to the probe function
    - Used dev_warn instead of dev_err in a few places
    - Removed no-op apple_smc_rtkit_shmem_destroy; this required an
      additional change in rtkit.c because we had a check there that's a
      bit too strict
    - Removed struct resource in apple_smc_rtkit_shmem_setup and
      open-coded resource_contains instead
    - Unwrapped lines with less than 100 chars
    - Made sure to compile with W=1 and ran scripts/kernel-doc -v
      on macsmc.h once and fixed any fallout
  - Removed first_key/last_key from struct smc and moved
    apple_smc_find_first_key_index to the gpio driver since it's only
    used there anyway to find the index of the first GPIO key (gP00)
  - Return -EIO when a command fails instead of whatever SMC returns
    which does not map to Linux errnos on errors

Changes between v3 and v4:
  - Added documentation for all functions and structs
  - Fixed dt-bindings and re-ordered commits so that the mfd one comes
    last and can include the gpio subdevice
  - Added the reset driver and corresponding bindings
  - Reworked the atomic mode inside SMC since the previous implementation
    called mutex_lock from atomic context
  - Removed the backend split for now which lead to a quite intense discussion
    for the previous versions which hadn't been solved as far as I could tell
    from the old threads.
    It's also been 2+ years and I haven't heard of any backend implementation
    for T2 or even older macs. It's also unclear to me which sub-devices
    are actually useful there because at least GPIO and shutdown/reboot
    from this series will not work as-is there.
    I'd rather have this initial version which only supports M1+ macs upstream
    and then iterate there if any other backend is developed.
    I'll gladly help to re-introduce backend support if it's ever required.
