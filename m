Yes I am aware of that.

Yes that is correct, my understanding is that the transmitter is in
charge of building a message whose payload can fit into the maximum
message size allowed by the underlying configured transport.

Indeed for that reason the scmi_get_max_msg_size that you introduced is
just enough since it allows you to peek into the transport and get the
max_msg_size...the misunderstanding is around the fact that I was simply
meaning that you should plug it into some new helper_ops so that yo can
call it like:

  max_msg = ph->hops->get_max_msg_size(ph);

(like iterators or get_extended_name)

Because in this way you could use it also when the protocol is build as
a loadable module, thing that now it is possible only for vendor defined
protocols, but we could also easily switch all the base protocols to be
selectable via Kconfig and =m in the future (if ever)

Your helper is fine by itself it is just that it cannot be called by a
protocol defined to loaded as a module because the symbol is not
exported and, indeed, we introduced the ph->hops thing just for this
reason, i.e. to have a set of common protocol utilities that can be
called even from loadable modules protocols without the need to export
every single symbol.

The reference to iterators and extended_name was misleading
probably...my bad...or I am still missing something :D

Thanks,
Cristian
