Hi Takahiro,

I see you are on track with this!

Some clarifications:

Yeah, it kind of requires a "pure" pin controller underneath that don't
want to do anything else on any operations, otherwise we are back
to a per-soc pin control driver.

But I think it is appropriate for abstractions that strive to provide
"total abstraction behind a firmware", so such as SCMI or ACPI (heh).

They are pretty much 1-to-1 slot-ins for the corresponding of_*
functions, passing struct device * instead of struct device_node *,
if you look in include/linux/property.h you will feel at home very
quickly.

Yeah that works, or pincontro_by_gpio_ or such.

I wrote some documentation! But it is hidden deep in the docs:
https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/gpio/driver.html#gpio-lines-with-open-dr=
ain-source-support

With open drain, on GPIO controllers that do not support a native
open drain mode, we emulate open drain output high by switching
the line into input mode. The line in this case has a pull-up resistor
(internal or external) and as input mode is high-Z the pull up resistor
will pull the signal high, to any level - could be e.g 48V which is
helpful for some serial links.

But this case is really tricky so it can be hard to get things right,
I get a bit confused and so we need to think about it a few times.

Grrr that must be my fault. Sorry about not fixing this :(

chip->set =3D scmi_gpio_set; gets called like this in gpiolib:

 gpiod_direction_output_raw_commit(..., int value)
{
    int val =3D !!value;
(...)
    gc->set(gc, gpio_chip_hwgpio(desc), val);

Notice clamping int val =3D !!value; will make the passed val 0 or 1.

Yes.

And it is this fact that the same number need to appear in two places
and double-specification will sooner or later bring us to the situation
where the two do not agree, and what do we do then?

If the ranges come from firmware, which is subject to change such
as "oops we forgot this pin", the GPIO number will just insert itself
among the already existing ones: say we have two ranges:

1: 0..5
2: 6..9

Ooops forgot a GPIO in the first range, it has to be bumped to
0..6.

But somewhere in the device tree there is:

foo-gpios =3D <&scmi_gpio 7 GPIO_OUT_LOW>;

So now this is wrong (need to be changed to 8) and we have zero tooling
to detect this, the author just has to be very careful all the time.

But I honestly do not know any better way.

Hehe, I think it is good that the SCMI firmware gets some exercise
from day 1!
