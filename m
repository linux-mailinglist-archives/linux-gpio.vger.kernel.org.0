And thanks for describing your maintainer's view, that's definitely

Sure, there is information in the form that marks those two pins for
being usable as I2C pins. But I feel like the function parameter is not
living up to its promise (see below).

... in that old embedded world where firmware is an opaque closed source
unfixable blob. Mainline Allwinner is all "organic": we have upstreamed
U-Boot and TF-A support, actively maintained, plus an Open Source
management firmware. Updating the firmware is a matter of "dd" or
"flashcp" - at least in theory. And I'd rather think of the kernel being
not easy to change - think Debian installer image, or getting it upstream
first, then backported, then picked up by a distro.
But I think this discussion slightly digresses here - at least following it
would double the length of this email ;-)

I'd argue that an application engineer just has to choose the right
pingroup DT node:
	pinctrl-0 =3D <&i2c2_pb_pins>;
In the worst case they go ahead and ask their hardware buddy, and create
a new pingroup node. In my experience the typical Allwinner users are more
on the hardware side, so are no strangers to looking up data sheets.

Ah, I think I get your point.

That is actually a good argument: At the moment I am happy with my
proposal (the allwinner,pinmux =3D <number>; property), but that seems like
standard #15 then.
So would biting the bullet and adopting the Apple/STM32 way then be more
sustainable?
On the other hand: the allwinner,pinmux solution has the advantage of being
already written and proven working, also it stays very close to the
existing description/binding - so implementations like U-Boot could just
keep on using the "function" string.

I am a bit torn here... I don't think I will find the solitude to
implement this "Apple" approach in the next few weeks.

I see your point - xkcd 927.

That's true, and I learned to step back from this ambition - it's
tempting, but indeed out of scope.
One thing to consider, though: the function names are effectively part of
the binding, since they must match exactly between the driver and DT - it's
not just a name. But they are documented nowhere. Names like "i2c0" or
"uart2" seem obvious, but there are ambiguities like "twi" vs "i2c" (the
former used in the vendor BSP), or "owa" vs "spdif" (same situation).
Also, is it "emac" or "emac0"? For some SoCs we discover a second
interface later: A523 just exposes one EMAC, but the A527 package (same
die) provides the pins for the second MAC as well. So I am afraid strings
are not as unique or straight-forward as we hope for.

So for creating a new pingroup, an application engineer would need to
check the Linux driver (or U-Boot? Or FreeBSD?) for the name to use - that
sounds somewhat wrong to me.
In the new model they just create a unique function name and enter the
pinmux from the datasheet - I think that's not too much to ask?

Yes, but for GPUs there is good rationale (because they are big
complicated pieces of hardware), and they are easily put into modules.
Pinctrl on the other hand is essential for *any* device to come up
(UART!), so having them in the image makes things much easier. Also
Allwinner pinctrl devices are not nearly as sexy as a Radeon or Geforce ;-)

I see, but I feel it's an orthogonal problem, and relies on the a
pessimistic firmware view (see above).
Having those gory SoC specific details in firmware (which is by
definition device specific) solves one big problem, though: there is a
chance that existing kernels would already run on new SoCs/boards.
But again: different discussion thread, I guess, and not what I ask for.

No, sorry, I cut out too much, it looks like this:

	SUNXI_PIN(SUNXI_PINCTRL_PIN(I, 5),
		  SUNXI_FUNCTION(0x5, "i2c0"),		/* SCK */
		...
        SUNXI_PIN(SUNXI_PINCTRL_PIN(I, 6),
		  SUNXI_FUNCTION(0x5, "i2c0"),		/* SDA */
		...
        SUNXI_PIN(SUNXI_PINCTRL_PIN(I, 7),
		  SUNXI_FUNCTION(0x5, "i2c1"),		/* SCK */
		...
        SUNXI_PIN(SUNXI_PINCTRL_PIN(I, 8),
		  SUNXI_FUNCTION(0x5, "i2c1"),		/* SDA */

So the function just selects the group, and the actual pin name is
completely irrelevant to the software side - hence the comment.
But this "put something not meant for the human reader into a comment"
typically points to something not being quite right.

Cheers,
Andre
