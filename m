Then the "slots" (obviously at least some of these are soldered down
rather than on actual slots) should be represented in DT and the
controller or bus should know that it needs to iterate over them to
bring up the chips.  I would also expect that there are standard names
in the PCI specs for the standard supplies that go into devices as part
of the bus spec which would mean that there should still be no need to
encode names like this.

The framework and/or driver can enumerate firmware information without
actually powering up the devices of course.

I would not be surprised to learn that most systems just mark the device
supplies always on, it's not like the devices will be able to use them
normally anyway.
