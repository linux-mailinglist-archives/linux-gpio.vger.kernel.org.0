Do I have to go read this to decipher the justification and reasoning?
When Greg says "in this patch series", he means in the commit messages
of the patches. You send v9 already and it doesn't have that. The
patchset needs to stand on its own summarizing any relevant prior
discussions.

I never suggested doing a revert. Obviously, someone still wants the
new feature. The issue is a new feature was added to the kernel, but
you are requiring a DT change to platforms NOT using the feature. Make
the platforms wanting the new feature to need a DT change. That's
still not great, but it's much better to affect new platforms rather
than old, stable platforms. The period of time that regresses is much
smaller (a few kernel releases vs. years potentially). Of course, if
it's just those 3 platforms and their maintainers are fine with
needing this DT change, then that works too. But there's no evidence
here that they are okay with it. You didn't even do the update of the
dts files and just left them broken.
