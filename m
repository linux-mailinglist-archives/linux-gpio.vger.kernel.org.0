I've already got the changes locally, so don't worry. There is nothing
critical or earth shattering in there, mainly how the hte_en flag is
passed around.  You followed the pattern provided by polarity_change,
which is only used on one occasion, when I would've followed the pattern
from line->eflags, which is used more widely.

Though I might take the changes a little further than I have to also
change the polarity_change flag to follow the eflags pattern to prevent
anyone following from falling into the same trap - still stewing on that.

The basic idea is that, particularly during reconfig, the struct line
contains the current applied state, while the desc->flags contain the
requested state.  The polarity_change flag was a bit of a lazy shortcut
to save from adding an active_low (or equivalent) flag to struct line.

Correct.
