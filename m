I explored about kdump and fadump(PPC) but they take another route to 
boot capture kernel, FAdump is even optimized and do not even boot
capture kernel instead reboot the same kernel with minimal
memory and once the reading of crash kernel region is complete
from user space it release the memories.

Latency in booting another kernel may not acceptable to boot time
sensitive devices like mobile, tablet etc., also to boot another
kernel will have security implication with user data..

So, Minidump is limited in its capability and uses firmware infra
to dump registered entries and boot afresh. So, it need to be
presented what need to be dumped via Minidump registration API.

If there is no comments, would like to go ahead with the next
revision of the patchset.
