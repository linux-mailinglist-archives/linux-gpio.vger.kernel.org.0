I looked around pinctrl drivers for mediatek. What I see there is that 
each subdriver has its own compatible string. There's a documentation 
for each subdriver. Each subdriver contains different pin groups and 
functions like on ralink. My patch series basically does the same for 
Ralink.

I don't see this patch series causing much of an issue for OpenWrt. 
They're going to have to update their Ralink DTs with the new compatible 
strings when they either switch to the next LTS kernel or decide to 
backport Ralink pinctrl changes to the current LTS kernel.

Cheers.
Arınç
