(i.eÂ  Some pins in hardware be configured as active low, this can vary between hardware samples. User application uses gpio-line-name property to map pins and port, this helps the application to handle pin change from hardware sample to sample.

Thanks for the input.

Can the maintainers please confirm how does they want to have this implemented?

i.e How to define the polarity for generic GPIOs exported to user space in the device tree, to be able to make user space GPIO usage independent of hardware revisions?


Thanks,
