No. Not that I know. My understanding is that the "VDR (voltage drop 
rate)" refers to measured voltage drop-rates under certain conditions - 
which can be used to (more accurately) estimate the remaining capacity 
when battery is nearly depleted. As far as I know, this is only used 
with Lithium-ion batteries (I am not at all sure of this) - but I 
_assume_ the technique could be applied to other type of batteries as well.

I see. The "VDR" stuff is really tightly bound to the fuel-gauging 
algorithm. It is measured characteristics of the battery - but those 
values are only usable by the "VDR" algorithm. I don't really have a 
good insight in the amount of fuel-gauging algorithm related properties 
suggested to be added during the years - but don't think there have been 
that many of them. So, I am not that worried about adding the 
compatible. On the other hand, there is no technical reason (other than 
adding properties which are unused on many platforms) why not to add the 
vdr tables in the static-battey node without adding own compatible. And, 
reading reply from Andreas (I'll copy it here to answer it in same mail)

I didn't know Kobos use multiple chargers. Thanks Andreas! So, in that 
sense, adding the "vdr" tables in static-battery node, without new 
compatible, would maybe be simplest solution. Then the charger(s) 
(fuel-gauge(s)) which implement VDR algorithm, can pick the tables while 
those chargers which don't implement the VDR will just ignore these tables.

For VDR there are only:

rohm,voltage-vdr-thresh-microvolt,
rohm,volt-drop-soc-bp,
rohm,volt-drop-temperatures-millicelsius

and

patternProperties:
   '^rohm,volt-drop-[0-9]-microvolt':

So, from the binding point of view (.yaml), it's not _that_ lot. In the 
.dts there will be quite some noise as the tables have several values.

I am under impression that chargers tend to be pretty flexible, and they 
can be configured to work with many different batteries by altering the 
charging profiles. Most of the battery properties (like and charging 
phases [like pre, CC, CV], their limits, currents and voltages etc) are 
very generally usable. So, large subset of charging functionality can be 
handled with standard properties. I believe it is only the fuel-gauging 
where things get more hairy.

I did prepare a series which does the split and adds new compatible for 
the 'rohm,vdr-battery'. (The power-supply class is not yet modified in 
the series, but we would probably want to modify the battery-info 
getters to also accept the 'rohm,vdr-battery' -compatible.)

I wonder if I should actually prepare also a series where these 
properties are just placed in the existing static battery node without 
adding new compatible. That way it would be easier to see which way is 
better.

If I do that, should I only spin these bindings as RFC to avoid the 
unnecessary noise?

Oh, and a big thanks to both of you Rob and Andreas!  I feel this gained 
more clarity after your feedback :)

Yours,
	-- Matti
