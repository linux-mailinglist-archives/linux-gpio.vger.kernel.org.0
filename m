Hi Rob, sorry for the late reply.

Having one node was the route I went in v1, but that was rejected as
it would mean
having an MFD driver that just registers the sub-drivers.
That is what the simple-mfd-i2c driver was designed to get rid of and
inherit the regmap
from the parent.
For this to work, subnodes are required as we need to match on compatibles.

Using subnodes for GPIO-s also gets rid of hardcoding the register
layout in the driver per board,
as Delta chose to use a weird register layout in which the GPIO
registers have completely random offsets.
The layout is even weirder in the TN4810M which uses the same CPLD but
expanded and is easily
supportable in the same driver in the current form.
My goal and the requirement from the community was to make the GPIO
driver as simple as possible
and extendable so that boards like TN4810M can be easily added.

Also, the Kontron SL28CPLD does pretty much the same in regards to DT
as well as other things.
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/kontron,sl28cpld.yaml?h=v5.16.15

It uses the same logic with different compatibles for GPIO to be able
to inform the kernel of the certain
bank capabilities.
I mean, using one compatible would be possible by using a boolean
property for example that tells you
that its output capable as well.

Regards,
Robert
