Hello,
It's my pleasure to have contact with you, based on the critical
condition I find mine self, though, it's not financial problem, but my
health, you might have know that cancer is not what to talk home
about, I am married to Mr. Shine Zuthimalin   who worked with Tunisia
embassy in Burkina Faso for nine years before he died in the year
2008.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a
brief  illness that lasted for five days. Since his death I decided
not to remarry, When my late husband was  alive he deposited the sum
of US$ 10 .2m (ten  million two hundred thousand dollars) in a bank in
Burkina Faso, Presently this money is still in bank. And My Doctor
told me that I don't have much time to  live because of the cancer
problem, Having known my condition I decided to hand you over this
fond to take  care of the less-privileged people, you will utilize
this money the way  I am going to instruct herein. I want you to take
30 Percent of the total money for your personal use While 70% of the
money will go to charity" people and helping the orphanage. I don't
want my husband's efforts to be used by the Government. I grew  up as
an Orphan and I don't have anybody as my family member,
Mrs. Shahinaz Zuthimalin
