Here is the next version of the sloppy GPIO logic analyzer. Changes
since last version:

* white space fix found by Andy, thanks!
* rebased to v5.17

For those new to this sloppy GPIO logic analyzer, here is a small
excerpt from a previous cover-letter with the links updated:

===

Here is the next update of the in-kernel logic analyzer based on GPIO
polling with local irqs disabled. It has been tested locally and
remotely. It provided satisfactory results. Besides the driver, there is
also a script which isolates a CPU to achieve the best possible result.
I am aware of the latency limitations. However, the intention is for
debugging only, not mass production. Especially for remote debugging and
to get a first impression, this has already been useful. Documentation
is within the patch, to get a better idea what this is all about.

A branch is here:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wsa/linux.git renesas/gpio-logic-analyzer-v8

And an eLinux-wiki page with a picture of a result is here:
https://elinux.org/Kernel_GPIO_Logic_analyzer

I've used the analyzer in a few more scenarios and on multiple SoCs
(Renesas R-Car H3 and M3-W) and was happy with the outcome. Looking
forward to other tests and comments. From my side this is good to go.

Thanks and happy hacking,

   Wolfram
