The cycles are gone because you skipped the problematic case in your
example.

Replace consumerA in your example with the I2C node providing access to
the PMIC which provides &vcc3v3_pmu and then you have the cycles back.

The I2C master device needs the IO domain which needs a regulator
provided by a client on the very same I2C master. The cycles are
actually there in hardware, you can't define them away ;)
