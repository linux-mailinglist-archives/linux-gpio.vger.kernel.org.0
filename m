False alarm on the breakage part, I got lost in the software layers.

There is a problem that if a non-ipq4019 device where to be pinconf'ed
for open-drain, the outcome would be unexpected and I have a concern
that someone one day would implement set_config().

So, I'd like to fix this, but my argumentation is at least wrong.

Perhaps we could convert that to yaml?

Thanks, I couldn't find a user, so this was helpful input for deciding
the path forward.

Thank you for taking a look, Brian. This was valuable input. I will
rework this to have a valid motivation - at least.

As my observation was incorrect, I don't think that is urgent.
