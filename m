Good point. I agree for the general case and also agree that it could have gap when such

providers exist. I will revisit this logic in next version 4.

I agree, I will correct the logic in next version 4.

This specific HTE provider hardware is designed to detect edges to ts only on

input lines and which also has IRQ enabled. So for an example, if

userspace requests both OUTPUT and hardware clock config on a line

HTE provider will not generate any TS event on them.

I have to be clear, I am not insisting anything here. I am only trying

to understand what else could fall into HTE's plate so that I can get it right.

I am agreeing everything in above comment. I will revisit this logic in next

revision 4.
