I understand - slippery slope and keeping minimal.
But I think we do need some solution for simple one line request cases that
can get users up and running with a smaller learning curve.
Then they can learn more if they want more.

> Do you think that users actually use it (core C libgpiod)?

Yeah, they do, believe it or not.  I'm mainly talking the vocal Pi crowd,
many of whom are used to going bare metal to the hardware, and are now
searching for an alternative.  libgpiod as it stands is too complicated for
them - they just want to drive a pin up and down or read a button.
There are a few other alternatives that let them do that, and they will
switch on that basis alone, and never look back, though they will happily
spread their rather toxic opinions of libgpiod vs those alternatives.

> I would think they stick to python and C++?

They are actually less likely to go C++ - more learning curve.
And Python can be considered too heavyweight in situations with limited
resources.

Sorry, I even haven't looked at the GLib bindings, but I will take a
look.  The core would be better if possible - they would be displeased
having to install yet another library just for basic commands.  But it
would be better than nothing.

This is what I currently have in mind for the C API:

/**
 * @}
 *
 * @defgroup olr One line requests - helper functions for basic use cases
 * @{
 *
 * Various functions that provide a simplified interface for basic use cases
 * where the request only contains one line.
 */

/**
 * @brief Request a single input line.
 * @param chip Path to the GPIO chip.
 * @param offset The offset of the GPIO line.
 * @return New line request object or NULL if an error occurred. The request
 *         must be released by the caller using ::gpiod_line_request_release.
 */
struct gpiod_line_request *
gpiod_olr_request_input(const char *path, unsigned int offset);

/**
 * @brief Request a single input line.
 * @param chip Path to the GPIO chip.
 * @param offset The offset of the GPIO line.
 * @param value The value to set the line.
 * @return New line request object or NULL if an error occurred. The request
 *         must be released by the caller using ::gpiod_line_request_release.
 */
struct gpiod_line_request *
gpiod_olr_request_output(const char *path,
			 unsigned int offset,
			 enum gpiod_line_value value);

/**
 * @brief Set the bias of requested input line.
 * @param olr The request to reconfigure.
 * @param bias The new bias to apply to requested input line.
 * @return 0 on success, -1 on failure.
 */
int gpiod_olr_set_bias(struct gpiod_line_request * olr,
		       enum gpiod_line_bias bias);

/**
 * @brief Set the debounce period of requested input line.
 * @param olr The request to reconfigure.
 * @param period The new debounce period to apply, in microseconds.
 * @return 0 on success, -1 on failure.
 */
int gpiod_olr_set_debounce_period_us(struct gpiod_line_request *olr,
				     unsigned long period);

/**
 * @brief Set the edge detection of requested input line.
 * @param olr The request to reconfigure.
 * @param edge The new edge detection setting.
 * @return 0 on success, -1 on failure.
 */
int gpiod_olr_set_edge_detection(struct gpiod_line_request * olr,
				 enum gpiod_line_edge edge);

/**
 * @}
 */

I think those 5 functions cover the basics.  That is it.  Done. No more.
Unless you can think of something I've missed.

I went with _olr_ as the prefix to clearly separate it from the existing,
but kept it as brief as possible.
It also chains with the trailing "d" in gpiod so it is pronouncable.

I was toying with adding get_value()/set_value(), but all they offered was
dropping the offset param, so not enough benefit and I dropped them.

I haven't put much thought into whether those should be carried through
to the bindings, but don't see any fundamental reason they couldn't.

Anyway, have a think about it.
And I'll go take a look at the GLib bindings.

Cheers,
Kent.
