Alright, I think now you got it and we are on the same page. If I
understood your suggestion, users would just use GPIO_PULL_UP in dtb if
wanting the default behavior. I would then use the gpiochip 'request()'
callback to test the for pull-up flag right?

If I'm getting this right, there's a problem with it...
gpiod_configure_flags() is called after gpiod_request() which means
that the gpiod descriptor won't still have the BIAS flags set. And I
don't think there's a way (at least clean and easy) to get the firmware
lookup flags from the request callback?

So, honestly the only option I see to do it without changing gpioblib
would be to hook this change in output/input callbacks which is far
from being optimal...

So, in the end having this explicitly like this feels the best option
to me. Sure, I can find some workaround in my driver but that does not
change this...


"
git grep "PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_DISABLE" drivers/gpio/

drivers/gpio/gpio-aspeed.c:963: else if (param =3D=3D
PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_DISABLE ||
drivers/gpio/gpio-merrifield.c:197:     if
((pinconf_to_config_param(config) =3D=3D PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_DISABLE) ||
drivers/gpio/gpio-omap.c:903:   case PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_DISABLE:

PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_DISABLE)
drivers/gpio/gpio-pca953x.c:592:        case PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_DISABLE:
"

AFAICT, the only way this path is possible for these drivers is through
gpiolib cdev which might not be what the authors of the drivers were
expecting...
