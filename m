Not a problem - that is what test suites are for.

Really?  With all the bits out in the open it seems pretty clear to me.
Clearer than scatter/gather in fact.

Sure, if there is suitable hardware support then bitmaps COULD be faster
than bitops.  But without that, and that is the general case, it will be
slower.  Do you have ANY cases where your implementation is currently
faster?  Then you would have a stronger case.

And if you find the existing implementation unclear then the appropriate
solution is to better document it, as bitmaps itself does, not replace it
with something simpler and slower.

v3 ABI?? libgpiod v2 is barely out the door!
Do you have any cases where 64 lines per request is limiting?
If that sort of speculation isn't premature optimisation then I don't know
what is.

Cheers,
Kent.
