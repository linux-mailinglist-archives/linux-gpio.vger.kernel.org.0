I also wonder what would happen when there are multiple RSB devices, and
we switch them back to I2C one by one. It's not like there's an option
to switch all of them back at the same time, unlike switching from I2C
to RSB. The A80 and A83T are the platforms that would be affected.

So I merged the previous patch, i.e. changes to the .dtsi, but I think
we should delay this one by a release. That would give us more time to
think about it, and let users upgrade U-Boot/TF-A.
