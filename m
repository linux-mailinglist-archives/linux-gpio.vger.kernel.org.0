Yes, you are biased. :-) Ask some stranger about this code and I am pretty sure
there will be double-figures percentage of people who can tell that the current
code is a bit voodoo.

Why do we care here about performance? But if we do, I would check this on
the 32-bit platform where 64-bit operations somewhat problematic / slow.

If Yury gives an idea about performance tests I can consider to add this
piece to compare with and we might see the difference.

Documentation will be needed either way. In general statistics it will be 50/50
who (mis)understands this or new code. Pity that the original author of the code
hadn't though about documenting this...

IIRC it was SO question where the OP asks exactly about breaking the 64 lines
limitation in the current ABI.

No, based on the real question / discussion, just have no link at hand.
But it's quite a niche, I can agree.
