Great. And that is what I meant by maintaining the development process -
patches still go via the list, not pull-requests.

Can we update the README to reference that?

I've created packages for both at some point, but never as part of
a distro, so I've got a rough idea how the packages themselves work but
no idea how the distro packagers select what goes where or when.
As with you - not something I've ever needed to have a concern for.

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help out.
