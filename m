The technical issue is that the driver does not match the hardware. We
must maintain the existing set of groups for backwards-compatibility.
But this should not prevent improvement.

Saying that we cannot have both group styles means that the driver is
permanently stuck with whatever was picked when it was submitted. Hence,
if you want to have only one style you had better review new drivers
very carefully.

There are 78 muxable pins on this hardware, and around 40 groups, each
with signals that can be muxed to each pin. If we were to create groups
for each combination of signals and pins, there would literally be
thousands of groups.

What I mean is that, for this hardware, groups are a Linux only concept.
Neither the firmware nor the hardware itself has a concept of groups.
While other hardware may have this concept, it does not apply here.

I do not object to groups where that is the hardware reality, but they
are unnecessarily constraining for this part.

Well, the former approach is wrong for this hardware, but we must
support it for backwards-compatibility. A combination is the obvious
solution.
