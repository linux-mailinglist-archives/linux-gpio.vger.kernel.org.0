Previously we've generally assumed that the defaults in the hardware
strapping register are in fact appropriate for the system and thus
have avoided making any changes to its contents (with the exception of
the bits controlling the GPIO passthrough feature).

Unfortunately, on some platforms corrections from software are
required as the hardware strapping is simply incorrect for the system
(such as the SPI1 interface being configured for passthrough mode when
master mode is in fact the only useful configuration for it).  We thus
remove the checks preventing changes to the strap register so that the
pinctrl subsystem can be used for such corrections.
