At SCMI probe time the SCMI core stack creates one device for each
'protocol_id/name' as provided by the registered SCMI drivers in
their respective scmi_device_id/id_tableS, as long as the requested
protocol is active in the DT (protocol@XX defined) and the 'name'
is not duplicated; each of these devices, sharing the same SCMI
protocol, are created sharing also the same DT node protocol@XX.

Their respective SCMI drivers are subsequently separately matched on
protocol_id/name and then probed as usual: it is up to the drivers not
to step on each other feet by competing for the same SCMI resources...
...like issuing comflicting request for the same reosurce domain
on the same protocol.

I suppose, though, a lot depends on how the respective drivers interact
with their subsystems, like IIO SCMI does not really need any info
from DT, and the hwmon uses just the phandle to pick the sensor_domain_id
to associate, as an example, to thermal sensors.

Beside the uglyness of having 2 different DT bindings schemas for 2
different drivers coexisting in the same parent protocol node, it is
still not clear to me why this cant be done technically without the need
of a new dummy 0x99 protocol_node, given that each driver can use its
own parsing logic in its probe, which is what Peng is doing in
dt_node_to_map indeed ...even though, maybe, the result would be so
ugly and/or not accepatble from bindings point of view that we will
not want to do it at the end anyway....I mean maybe it is just the
attempt itself to combine the Generic Pinctrl approach with the highly
specific IMX approach that inevitably leads to these clashes...

...I maybe missing something, though, so I'll made some experiments on
my side about this before I'll keep on blabbing :P

Thanks,
Cristian
