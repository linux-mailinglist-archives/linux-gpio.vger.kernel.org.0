Will do.

Wrt decoupling, I was thinking of both input and output, not just output,
though it was the output that got me onto that line of thought as
gpiod_direction_output sets bias, but gpiod_direction_output_raw doesn't.
That seemed totally arbitrary.

That lead to thinking that the gpiod_direction_output (and _input) is now 
doing more than implied by the name, and by the documentation for that 
matter.  So perhaps it should be split out and promote gpio_set_bias to
gpiod_set_bias?  Anyway, that was the line of thought.
The problem there being some callers of gpiod_direction_input already
expect it to set bias, at least on a best effort basis, and they would 
have to be updated to call gpiod_set_bias.

Maybe just update the documentation for exported functions that do set 
bias?

May as well - I've got it all in the one branch anyway.

I was about to start updating libgpiod to add set_config, after adding
the equivalent to my gpiod library (nearly finished writing the tests 
for that), but I'll put all that on the back burner and get v5,
including in the set_config patches, out as soon as I can.

Cheers,
Kent.
