Yeah, that's exactly what this is being used for. It's used to restore
the parent/child relationship during resume after the registers have
been wiped during supend.

Okay, I think I see what you're saying. The current implementation does
carry a bit of a risk because users could be calling this function with
any arbitrary pair of struct clk_hw *, even completely unrelated ones.

How about we turn it into this instead:

	/**
	 * clk_hw_get_parent_index - return the index of the parent clock
	 * @hw: clk_hw associated with the clk being consumed
	 *
	 * Fetches and returns the index of parent clock. Returns -EINVAL if the g=
iven
	 * clock does not have a current parent.
	 */
	int clk_hw_get_parent_index(struct clk_hw *hw)
	{
		struct clk_hw *parent =3D clk_hw_get_parent(hw);

		if (!parent)
			return -EINVAL;

		return clk_fetch_parent_index(hw->core, parent->core);
	}
	EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(clk_hw_get_parent_index);

I think that has the advantage that we can't pass it a parent that's not
really a parent. There's still the slightly weird case where the clock
doesn't have a current parent, but hopefully that's something we are not
going to encounter much. After all this only makes sense to be called on
mux clocks and they always do have a parent by definition.

Perhaps we should be more explicit and wrap that !parent conditional in
a WARN_ON()? In my local patches I do that at the call sites because
they are all functions returning void, so we'd be silently ignoring the
cases, but I think it may make sense to have it in the core.

Any thoughts?

Thierry
