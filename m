This is a generic GPIO chip; so I guess any use case for ->to_irq()?

That's fine, and I don't require ->to_irq() to be called. The IRQ chip
in my case is provided by an MFD driver (axp20x to be specific) and it
*does* work orthogonally to the GPIO driver -- the GPIO driver neither
knows nor cares about the IRQ chip.

This is my use case; specifically, GPIO keys and ASoC jack detection.

Well, this is how MFD drivers with GPIO functionality often work, they
aren't creating a special IRQ sub-domain for GPIOs and it doesn't seem
to be a problem there. Most likely because those MFD devices are being
used for GPIO keys or something similar.

Referring to the interrupt directly would make sense if the GPIO was
wired to another chip's IRQ line, but that is unlikely to be the case
for MFD devices because they're behind a slow bus.

Yeah, that's accurate for my use case.

I'm not trying to argue that hierarchical IRQ domains are always a bad
thing -- I'm just pointing out they're not always useful or necessary.
All your points make sense when the GPIO controller is a large distinct
block with potentially many GPIOs. When we're dealing with an MFD device
with just a few GPIOs, maybe even just one, having a separate IRQ domain
makes less sense; the added structure is generally not useful.

Looking at other GPIO drivers using a hierarchical IRQ domain, they
include their own IRQ chips with specialized ops. In my case I don't
need any of that (and it'd be the same with other MFD devices) so it
looks like using an IRQ domain would mean I'd have to create a fake
IRQ chip and domain just to translate between two number spaces.

Is that really better than simply using ->to_irq()?

Aidan
