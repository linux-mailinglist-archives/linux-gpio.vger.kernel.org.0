So, if this was 845, the wakeup hardware would be the PDC.  Only a 
specific number of GPIOs are routed to the PDC.  When the TLMM is 
powered off in suspend, the PDC pays attention to the GPIOs that are 
routed to it, and are configured in the PDC as wakeup sources.  When the 
GPIO is asserted, the signal to the TLMM gets lost, but the PDC catches 
it.  The PDC will kick the CPU/SoC out of suspend, and then once the 
wakup process is complete, replay the GPIO so that the TLMM has the signal.

In your example, 14 would be the 14th GPIO that is routed to the PDC. 
You would need SoC hardware documentation to know the mapping from PDC 
line 14 to GPIO line X.  This is going to be SoC specific, so 845 
documentation is not going to help you for SC8XXX.

Chances are, you are going to need to get this documentation from 
Qualcomm (I don't know if its in IPCatalog or not), and put SoC specific 
lookup tables in the TLMM driver.

Does that make sense, or did I not answer the question you were actually 
asking?
