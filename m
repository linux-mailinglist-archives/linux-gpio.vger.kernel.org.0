I suggesting to make clear in the commit message that:
- there is no bug per se with the code logic (i.o.w.
  there is no issue to have allocations bigger than one page)
- this is very rarely case when it might be a problem

You can also put a reference to the documentation, if you wish.
This should be harmless and adding not more than a line into
the commit message (or even as a Link: tag to the HTML variant of it).
