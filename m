Sure, but I'm pretty clueless when it comes to what this GTE thing
does (it has a fast car ring to it, which isn't a selling point for
me... ;-).

If, as I understand it, it is supposed to collect timestamps on
signalling of IRQs, you could make it part of the kernel's view of the
interrupt path by "pushing" a domain on top of the IRQ stack,
triggering the configuration/timestamping of this interrupt.

What is completely unclear to me is how you extract information from
it. The IRQ doesn't really give you an interface to extract a lot of
information aside from an interrupt count and what is defined as the
interrupt state. A timestamp doesn't really count as state, so you'd
need to invent something new here.

Thanks,

	M.
