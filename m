Functionality aside, having random boolean flags in a function parameter
list is a horrid way to have an api.  Now when you see a call to this
function with either "true" or "false" as an option, you have no idea
what that means.  So you need to go look up this definition and then
work backwards.

So even if the idea is sane (I'm not saying that), this implementation
is not acceptable at all.
