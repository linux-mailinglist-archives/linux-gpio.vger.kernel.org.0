This would be kind of the same thing what the
GPIOD_FLAGS_BIT_NONEXCLUSIVE does, which was a quick workaround for
fixed-regulators afaik.

But let's say that a board design will pick two components (C1 and C2)
and use the same GPIO line to enable them. We already have the drivers
for them and they are used in boards already.

Both needs the GPIO line to be high for normal operation.
One or both of them needs register writes after they are enabled.

During boot both requests the GPIO (OUTPUT_LOW) and sets it high, then
run the register setup.

C1 request GPIO (LOW)
C1 gpio_set(1)
C1 register writes
C2 requests GPIO (LOW)
 C1 placed to reset and looses the configuration
C2 gpio_set(1)
 C1 also enabled
C2 register writes

At this point C2 is operational, C1 is not.

In shared GPIO case the GPIO should be handled like a regulator with a
twist that the 'sticky' state of the GPIO might be low or high depending
on the needs of the components it is connected to.

The shared GPIO line is a board design quirk and basically any device
which have reset/enable GPIO must be able to work in a situation when
they are sharing that line with other components and the driver should
not know much about this small detail.
