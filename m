Hi Bjorn,

we've got a customer dump that the real racy happened, and the system 
frequently have printk message like:
   "not freeing pin xx (xxx) as part of deactivating group xxx - it is
already used for some other setting".
Finally the system crashed after the flood log.

We've inform the customer to check their own client code which called 
this api, to have proper lock to avoid racy of per dev 
pinctrl_select_state call from customer driver end.
For example:
LOCK;
pinctrl_select_state();
gpio pulling;
udelay();
check state;
other hardware behaviors;
UNLOCK;

While it is still unnecessary the volatile re-load of p->state for the 
interation and so I upstream a patch like link[2].

while during the merge discussion, upstream maintainer suggest to have 
the lock issue fixed, instead of only READ_ONCE for the interation.
I think it is also make sense since although current in-tree driver have 
take care of each pinctrl_select_state call, since it is a export 
symbole and we've see the similar issue continuously (a year back ago 
also we've seen similar issue before[3]).

For this part, I am thinking about a spin lock is introduced and have 
the error log out of the lock will be safer.
The current patch disable irq during the lock, and some console driver 
rely on interrupt to get tx dma/fifo ready.
Also console driver will be a pinctrl client, so avoid unnecessary 
recursive in theory.
Just incase some out of tree concole driver was able to use the 
pinctrl_select_state in console write related APIs as well.
