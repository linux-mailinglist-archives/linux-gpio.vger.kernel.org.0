That's basically what my series does already, I return -EPROBE_DEFER
from the pinctrl driver when a pin is requested and the IO domain is not
yet ready.

No. We could do that, but it wouldn't buy us anthing. I am glad to hear
that fw_devlink can break the circular dependencies. With this we could
add the supplies to the pinctrl node and the pinctrl driver would still
be probed.

With the IO domain supplies added to the pinctrl node our binding would
be cleaner, but still we would have to defer probe of many requested
pins until finally the I2C driver providing access to the PMIC comes
along. We also still need a "Do not defer probe for these pins" property
in the pingrp needed for the I2C driver.

I would consider this being a way to cleanup the bindings, but not a
solution at DT core level that Linus was aiming at.

By making the IO domain device a child node of the pinctrl node we
wouldn't need a phandle from the pinctrl node to the IO domain node
anymore, but apart from that the approach is equivalent to what we have
already.

Given that fw_devlink allows us to add the supplies directly to the
pinctrl node, I would prefer doing that. But as said, it doesn't solve
the problem.
