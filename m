Sure tested this on Juno on top of v6.0-rc1 and found no regressions.
So,

Tested-by: Sudeep Holla <sudeep.holla@arm.com>

Just wanted to check if the logs are intentional or do you plan to make
them debug. On Juno with hardly few such dependencies I get below extra
logs during boot, it may add loads on other platforms. I am fine either
way, just thought of checking.
