Hi Linus,

Thanks a lot for the quick response.

Correct.

Agreed.

I don't have much knowledge on generic pinmux conf and suggested Peng
to post the RFC to start the discussion instead of getting blocked by me
during some internal/private discussions as the main intention for him
was upstreaming the changes. I am against the idea of mixing platform
specific changes the way it is done here but since I didn't have much
knowledge on pinmux conf to suggest/provide any useful feedback I suggested
to trigger this discussion.
