Sorry for that, I assumed the interface should be as close as possible 
to pstore, but apparently that's not the case. Why does it have to be 
different from it? It provides the same functionality and is 
configurable even if it doesn't explicitly configure non discoverable 
hardware properties.

Assuming we make the driver picks the values, how would it do that?Â  
Hardcoding a configuration could lead to a few problems, such as the 
allocated region being smaller than the driver defaults or driver 
defaults not fully utilizing the allocated region, possibly wasting more 
memory than it'll ever use. On top of that what happens if we want to 
configure it differently than the hardcoded default values? Via cmdline 
options? For example in the previous version it allocated the whole 
region for the console alone, while other entries, such as pmsg that 
could be useful on devices using minidump to store Android logs, was 
zero-sized.
