Using this ways that put offset property into device-tree that can be
compatible with future GPIO chips without the need to modify drivers,
such as more 2K chips in the future, but use of_match_data and data
field of_device_id, which every time a new SoC is released, the GPIO
driver needs to be modified once, which is not friendly to us.

Thanks,
