Sharing my thoughts:

Your patch is inspired from how kexec allocate memory for crash kernel
right? There is a series [1] which moved arch code (ARM64/x86) to
generic kexec core. Something we should also do as the feedback
received here.

Coming to how part, we still have to use memblock API to increase the chance
of allocating contiguous memory. Since PSTORE_RAM can also be
compiled as a module, we probably need another pstore layer that needs to
be built statically in kernel to allocate memory using memblock API.
once slab is available, all memblock API will re-direct to slab
allocations. This layer can be enabled via ARCH_WANTS_PSTORE_xxx or 
another config that only supports 'y'. PSTORE_RAM can still be a module but 
when this layer is available, it supports dynamic ramoops. Another option 
would be just including this layer in PSTORE RAM module but take away module 
option  when this layer is enabled.
