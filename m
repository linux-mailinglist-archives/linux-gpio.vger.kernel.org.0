Which may or may not be okay. It plays too smart, so the end developer
won't care about real headers they need as they are the only ones who
know the source code in the best possible way.

See above, the protocols.h it's a reincarnation (much less twisted and
ugly, though) of something like kernel.h. Do you know why we have a
split to headers instead of having everything in one? It speeds up a
build, it separates namespace (to the extent of what we call
"namespace" in C language), it makes the modularization (of the source
code) better (easier to avoid considering what's not needed), and so
on. I don't think making a "common" header is a good idea.

Yeah. That's why it's good to teach people about many aspects of the C
language (which is not popular, in particular due to these nuances,
nowadays and we are starving for good developers).

Yes. That's why we now have cleanup.h. Please, consider using it instead.

No. Its scope is to clean the probe-remove parts, one should not
spread it otherwise and one definitely should know its limitations and
corner cases (I even gave some examples back in ca. 2017 in one of my
presentation WRT typical mistakes the developers make

I understand the motivation, but again, devm is a beast in the corner
cases. I believe Laurent Pinchart gave a presentation about how bad
devm can hit you if you don't know what you are doing (OTOH it's hard
to know with devm).

Probably, just have a look at cleanup.h.

As I said, it's your call, I'm not preventing you from applying
whatever is going on in the SCMI subsystem. Just tried to point out
the problem(s).
