In pinctrl-sc8180x driver you wrote, it has sc8180x_pinctrl.ngpios = 191.
Which one of you should I listen to :)

BTW, if you read this number from DTS, I already sent you a series to
fix them.

As it's clear that the real GPIO number is 24, and the only possible map
in sc8180x_pdc_map[] is:

	{ .gpio = 24, wakeirq = 37 }

So we need to understand how 14 turns to 37.
