That may be true, but I think we can also try to catch abuses in
reviews. I would be a bit sad if we made life more difficult (and less
efficient at runtime too) for legitimate users just because we are
worried about abuses.

Another thing I've been thinking about is that we may not always want to
wait for the GPIO delay. Some consumers may not care when the GPIO line
reaches the desired state as long as it eventually does, or maybe they
need to perform multiple operations (such as enabling/disabling
regulators and/or clocks) and only need a synchronization point for a
group of operations. All that would be pretty hard to handle, and maybe
it's a problem we'll look at only when needed (and hopefully never).
