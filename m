I found three drivers (not exhaustive) that have fields for setting the
output level: gpio-amd8111, gpio-creg-snps, and gpio-lp3943. Admittedly
that's more than I expected, so maybe we shouldn't dismiss the idea of
multi-bit output fields.

If you still think the API you're suggesting is better then I can go
with it, but IMHO it's more code and more special cases, even if only
a little bit.
