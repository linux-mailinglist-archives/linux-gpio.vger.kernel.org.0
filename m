Sure.

I don't have time to answer all questions, sorry.

Please help review submitted patches to reduce my load and allow me to
answer other stuff :)

Yes, but what type of parent is that?

Again, what is the real type of that parent?  It's a port, right, so
pass in the port to this function and then do the "take the struct
device of the port" at that point in time.
