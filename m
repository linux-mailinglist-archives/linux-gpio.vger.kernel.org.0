Hi Rob,
I am sorry, but this is exactly what I "deciphered" from your
original email.

I am trying very hard to understand exactly what you mean, but it is
not that obvious for me. If something is not clear in my commit message,
I will try to improve it. But before, let's try to focus on making sure
I understand more clearly what you want exactly.

> new feature.

I assume that you refer to the "new feature" as what was added in
the commit 679875d1d880 ("sc16is7xx: Separate GPIOs from modem control
lines")?

Because I did not add a "new feature" myself, I simply restored (or
want to restore) what was working before commit 679875d1d880
(restore GPIO pins as GPIO functions).

I will wait for your clarification on this, and answer your other
comments after.

Hugo.
