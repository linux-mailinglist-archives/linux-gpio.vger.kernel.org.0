For tps6594 and tps65224, some core registers are at different adresses
indeed, but the code is the same for both MFD I2C/SPI entry points. As an
example, the way CRC is enabled is exactly the same, even if the bit that
must be set belongs to different registers. tps65224 has more resources and
it's as if HW designers had had to re-organize the way bits are distributed
among the registers (due to a lack of space, so to speak).

That said, if we consider that these devices are not compatible, what does it
imply concretely for the next version ? Does that mean that:
1) Only a new binding must be created, even if MFD drivers and most of child
drivers will be re-used ? (then the binding would simply be duplicated, but
the drivers would not)
2) A new binding and new MFD drivers must be created, even if most of child
drivers will be re-used ? (then the binding and MFD drivers would simply be
duplicated, but the child drivers would not)
3) A new binding and new drivers (MFD and child devices) must be created ?
4) Anything else ?

@Conor: I understand that it's not your problem. Anybody can answer, I just
try to make things clear for the next version. :)
