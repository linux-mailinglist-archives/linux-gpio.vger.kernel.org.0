Self replying myself. I gave myself some time to think about that but I
still have more thought now that I've written the previous email, and
re-read almost all old revisions of this series.

I do like this auxdev proposal. More so than current MFD revision. One
really nice feature is that it centralises access to iomem. I've
noticed recently a register that has most its fields for reset but one
lost bit dealing with a clock mux. Logic to handle that would be in one
location.

Also, I just noticed you hinted at auxiliary devices in previous emails,
which I thought was a generic term. I did not see it as a specific
kernel infrastructure to be used. Sorry about that.
