It looks like the two SPMI busses share the mapping table which is OK
because it's read-only but then the 'chnls' and 'obsrvr' regions are
also shared. There must be some global lock in place to make sure the
two controllers aren't writing to the same register in there? Or are we
saved because the mapping table splits the regions between the two
busses?

Nice trick. The reg properties aren't supposed to change order though so
we shouldn't do that.

It feels like we should make a parent node that holds the core, chnls,
obsrvr reg properties with a new compatible string and then have two
child nodes for each bus. Then the various PMICs can hang off those two
different bus nodes. Of course, it needs DT review to make sure nothing
else goes wrong.

How is it used in the driver? Does something care what is primary and
what is secondary?
