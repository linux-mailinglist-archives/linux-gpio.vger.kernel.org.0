Which is a (linux) software abstraction of an electric wire coming out
from the gpio (or gpo) controller then split into two (or more branch)
and connect to external components...

A GPIO pin configured as output is O ;)

Yes. Things gets a bit blurry when a GPIO line is used to enable/gate
signals from/to a chip on top of enable/disable, like muting an
amplifier's analog output.

I would say that coming out of reset is always forced as there is a
reason why you want to take it out - it is going to be used.

When we have only one user of the GPIO reset/enable line we will have a)
and b) happening. If the GPIO is shared most likely the intention of the
hw design dictates c) and d)

The later.

This is what regulators and the reset framework is doing, no?

grep -R enable-gpios Documentation/devicetree/bindings/*

pick two random device from the output, place it on a board with shared
enable GPIO line.
I know I over simplify (or complicate) the real world use.

You mean that users would use reset_control_get_optional_shared() only
and if there is no valid reset binding that the reset core would look
for a gpio binding and instantiate a gpio-reset controller?
But before instantiating it, it would look around in some list to see if
the gpio-reset controller for the same gpio line is already exist?

I'm not sure about that.
D1 have ENABLE pin (enable-gpios as per dt documentation),
 if the line is high, the device is enabled, if low it is disabled.

D2 have RESET pin (reset-gpios as per dt documentation),
 if the line is high, the device is enabled, if low it is disabled.

D1's driver would:
enable-gpios = <&gpio1 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

priv->reset = reset_control_get_optional_shared(dev, "enable");

/* Place it to reset: ENABLE pin should be pulled low */
reset_control_assert(priv->reset);
/* Remove from reset: ENABLE pin should be high */
reset_control_deassert(priv->reset);

D2's driver would:
reset-gpios = <&gpio1 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

priv->reset = reset_control_get_optional_shared(dev, "reset");

/* Place it to reset: RESET pin should be pulled low */
reset_control_assert(priv->reset);
/* Remove from reset: RESET pin should be high */
reset_control_deassert(priv->reset);

The reset framework must know somehow that the reset control for D1 is
an enable type of gpio, so it must treat it as inverted polarity while
the reset type of binding should be follow the selected active level.

Then it must protect (most likely) the deasserted state: it does not
mater if there is any assert request for the reset_control if we have
one deassert active as at least one device must be enabled.

For new dts files the virtual reset-gpio controller node can be present
and the level of assert and deassert is told to it via the gpio binding.

Something like this?

Not sure if I follow you here.

On the other hand the gpio line itself can be seen as a regultator
itself (3.3V most of the time) so in theory all GPIOs can be regulators
as well, but regulator framework protects the >0 volt state while there
are devices which can be enabled when the ENABLE/RST pin is pulled low.
