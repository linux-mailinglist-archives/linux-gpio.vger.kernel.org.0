Here we are

I see this order in dmesg
[   48.429681] sdhci-pci 0000:00:01.2: Mapped GSI37 to IRQ79
[   48.436219] sdhci-pci 0000:00:01.0: Mapped GSI0 to IRQ80
[   48.450347] sdhci-pci 0000:00:01.3: Mapped GSI38 to IRQ81

which suggests that PCI enabling devices are happening in parallel
(pcim_enable_device() in SDHCI PCI driver) and whoever wins first gets
the ID via IDA (see mmc_alloc_host() implementation). But PCI itself
guarantees that function 0 has to be always present, so the PCI itself
enumerates it _always_ in the same order (and we are talking about exactly
BDF == x:y.0 in this case).

I'm testing a PoC of the script, so looks promising, but needs more time to
check other possibilities (see below) and deploy.

blkid shows UUID for the partition of interest and it doesn't have any label,
OTOH I could parse it for the specific template, while it's less reliable than
going via sysfs from PCI device name, that's defined by hardware and may not be
changed.
