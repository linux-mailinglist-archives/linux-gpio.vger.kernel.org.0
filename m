Yep, that's right.

If moving to hierarchical IRQ chips is the plan, could we add a note
to say .to_irq() is discouraged and shouldn't be used in new code?
Based on what you're saying (which I agree makes sense) it sounds
like there's really no reason to ever use .to_irq().

Okay, that sounds like a good plan. I'll look more carefully at the
existing drivers and see if I can use existing gpiolib helpers.

One potential issue (from reading the code) is that hierarchical IRQ
domains seemingly can't have a non-hierarchical domain as the parent:
irq_domain_alloc_irqs_parent() calls irq_domain_alloc_irqs_hierarchy()
and the latter fails with -ENOSYS for a non-hierarchical domain.

In my case I'm using a regmap IRQ chip, which is non-hierarchical,
so perhaps that will need to be expanded?

Aidan
