Sadly I don't think that's going to happen, though.

For i915 the panels are described by VBT, or Video BIOS Tables. We don't
really know the make or model of the panels, we just get the timings and
sequences etc. from there. There's no info to probe a separate panel
driver. So we just have a "generic" DSI driver that's part of i915 which
uses the data from the VBT to drive all the possible panels.

We do use some of the drm DSI framework as a library to abstract things
a bit better, but that's about it.

The sequences should include details about GPIOs to toggle as well, so
in that sense I feel like the gpio calls should be bolted there.

BR,
Jani.
