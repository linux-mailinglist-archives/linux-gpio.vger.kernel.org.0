The gpioline_info_v2 now looks like this:

/**
 * struct gpioline_info_v2 - Information about a certain GPIO line
 * @name: the name of this GPIO line, such as the output pin of the line on
 * the chip, a rail or a pin header name on a board, as specified by the
 * gpio chip, may be empty
 * @consumer: a functional name for the consumer of this GPIO line as set
 * by whatever is using it, will be empty if there is no current user but
 * may also be empty if the consumer doesn't set this up
 * @config: the configuration of the line.  Note that the values field is
 * always zeroed.
 * @offset: the local offset on this GPIO device, fill this in when
 * requesting the line information from the kernel
 * @padding: reserved for future use
 */
struct gpioline_info_v2 {
	char name[GPIO_MAX_NAME_SIZE];
	char consumer[GPIO_MAX_NAME_SIZE];
	struct gpioline_config config;
	__u32 offset;
	__u32 padding[GPIOLINE_INFO_V2_PAD_SIZE]; /* for future use */
};

Previously that had all the fields from config - other than the values.

When that is populated the config.values will always be zeroed.

OK. It is a trivial change - I've already got the patch for it.

It will be an internal cap only - no error if the user requests more.
I was thinking 1024, which corresponds to the maximum default - 16*64.

Agreed.
