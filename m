What I stated is kernel policy as I understand it.

What you describe is what I would consider to be prototyping.
If you want play with bitbashing SPI, or whatever, go knock yourself out.
If you want to release that in a product then you really should
be using the kernel driver if one is available.
Bitbashing should be the last resort.

The note is is a rewording of a section of the existing sysfs documentation:

    DO NOT ABUSE SYSFS TO CONTROL HARDWARE THAT HAS PROPER KERNEL DRIVERS.
    PLEASE READ THE DOCUMENT AT Subsystem drivers using GPIO TO AVOID REINVENTING
    KERNEL WHEELS IN USERSPACE. I MEAN IT. REALLY.

So I've already toned down the vineger.

And your suggestion seems at odds with your earlier argument - we should suggest
that such a user write a kernel driver??

Indeed, this paragraph is in response to community discussions, one of
which was looking for a something official that says this.
Now there is one.

I consider that outside the scope of the API.

Sadly the latter.

To exand on Andy's response, within the notation '[' and ']' are inclusive,
'(' and ')' are exclusive.

Too esoteric?

My preference would be to put a note in the appropriate ioctl than provide
specific examples in the error codes.
The descriptions here should remain general.

That one probably should be explicitly stated in GPIO_V2_GET_LINE_IOCTL.

I've tried to keep the kernel a black box from the userspace perspective.
And the sentence explicitly includes "from the userspace perspective"
for that reason.

Where I do provide details of the internal workings it remains high
level - "the kernel does this".

I do not want to go into the detais of kernel internal components here
- out of scope.

I'm not sure anything is guaranteed by all the line drivers ;-).

But, AIUI, we should be all good. AFAIAA, and I stand to be corrected if I'm
wrong, none of the actions we perform on the driver would trigger a glitch
unless the driver is buggy.

It certainly wont glitch output line values like releasing and requesting
the line with the new config could - and that is independent of driver.

Everything there boggles the mind.

How does this API do anything that such a user needs to "beware" of?
Here if they use their janky overloading behaviour they get an error and
have to switch to the correct knob.  Is that scary ;-).
