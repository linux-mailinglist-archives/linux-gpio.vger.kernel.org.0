Makes sense (1).

Datasheets are publicly available (at least one may google and find some
information about those PCH chips). I have in possession the hardware for
gpio-pch. I can easily test that part at least.

With regard to (1) probably we may exceptionally accept the fix to gpio-ml-ioh,
but I really prefer to do the much more _useful_ job on it by unifying the two.
