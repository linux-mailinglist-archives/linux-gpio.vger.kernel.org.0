The maintainers in this subsystem refuse to review any patches which have
any kind of feedback. I have been trying to get them to look at this series
for literal months. So saying things like "I don't like this series, have
a NACK" seriously delays the process of getting feedback...

All I can say is that

- It doesn't work on my board
- The traces are on the bottom of the PCB
- The signal goes through an FPGA which (unlike the LS1046ARDB) is closed-source
- The alternative is polling once a second (not terribly intensive)

I think it's very reasonable to make this change. Anyway, it's in a separate
patch so that it can be applied independently.

and "doesn't changing PLL frequencies on the
> fly affect other lanes that use those PLLs, like PCIe?".

This driver is not enable on any boards with PCIe on the same serdes. Therefore,
this is irrelevant for the initial submission.

I'm opposed to nebulous 11th hour objections.

I would like to emphasize that this has *nothing to do with this driver*.
This behavior is part of the boot ROM (or something like it) and occurs before
any user code has ever executed. The problem of course is that certain RCWs
expect the reference clocks to be in certain (incompatible) configurations,
and will fail the boot without a lock. I think this is rather silly (since
you only need PLL lock when you actually want to use the serdes), but that's
how it is. And of course, this is only necessary because I was unable to get
major reconfiguration to work. In an ideal world, you could always boot with
the same RCW (with PLL config matching the board) and choose the major protocol
at runtime.

Sorry, I was a bit standoffish, but frankly I don't think leading off with
"NACK, no feedback for you today" is particularly collaborative either.
