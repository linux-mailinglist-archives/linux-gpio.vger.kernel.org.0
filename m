@Linus I think @Rob is referring to brcm,bcm6345-gpio:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/a74e6a014c9d4d4161061f770c9b4f98372ac778/drivers/gpio/gpio-mmio.c#L686

However, the real difference between BCM6345 (and BCM6338) is that these 
SoCs have no pin controller at all, only a GPIO controller:

BCM6345:
typedef struct GpioControl {
   uint16        unused0;
   byte          unused1;
   byte          TBusSel;
   uint16        unused2;
   uint16        GPIODir;
   byte          unused3;
   byte          Leds;
   uint16        GPIOio;
   uint32        UartCtl;
} GpioControl;

BCM6338:
typedef struct GpioControl {
   uint32        unused0;
   uint32        GPIODir;      /* bits 7:0 */
   uint32        unused1;
   uint32        GPIOio;       /* bits 7:0 */
   uint32        LEDCtrl;
   uint32        SpiSlaveCfg;
   uint32        vRegConfig;
} GpioControl;

BCM6348 and newer also have pinctrl.
That's the main difference between that driver @Rob's referring to and 
the ones in this patch series.
