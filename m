This is indeed our current DT usage for the Pi 5 family - a single DTB
describing each board - although I would like to make it clear that
overlays can then be applied on top of it describing the attached
peripherals.

This halfway house combines the advantages and disadvantages of
scenarios 1 and 3. Compared to scenario 3 it gains support for
applying overlays that make use of interfaces provided by RP1 - I2C,
SPI, UARTs etc. Compared to scenario 1 it loses the ability for the
base DTB to refer to elements of RP1, other than by replacing these
DTB elements with overlays that must be loaded after the RP1 overlay.
As such, we would see that as a backwards step and not use it.

Thank you for this - the creation of a core RP1 declaration that can
be tailored to multiple applications using different wrappers is
exactly what I had in mind. I agree that your partitioning scheme can
cater for the 3 usage scenarios, but for the reasons outlined above I
think scenario 2 is not useful to us, although it isn't impossible
that U-boot might see things differently; I see no harm in having it
supported, but I wouldn't want anyone to go to unnecessary effort to
make it work.
