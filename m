I guess you simply didn't get. The "gpio-line-names" property of GPIO
*controller* (provider!) and you are trying to do something with the *consumer*
if I got it right.

And of course GPIO line, which has name, has no difference in use from another
w/o name assigned. You will need to request it by *consumer* either in kernel
or in user space.

To be more precise we have to look at your DSDT.
