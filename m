On EyeQ5 yes.
On EyeQ6L and EyeQ6H (next revisions, different compatible), no.

I see where you are coming from. In my mind syscons make sense here
because most features in the block are only small additions/tweaks to
existing blocks. A few examples:

 - eMMC DMA integration config
 - eMMC high impedance register
 - OSPI high impedance register

Those cannot be abstracted. The main node is elsewhere and it needs
access to those registers.

Some other registers however will be able to be abstracted away, as
custom clocks for example (eg I'm seeing SGMII PLL control register).
That is not the case for all however.

Do you have examples of existing nodes that both are syscons and expose
multiple resources (clocks, resets, etc)? I did not envision this as
possible which is why I didn't go this route. Also, this would require
big changes to dt-bindings currently in v6.9-rc.

To be honest, I do not comprehend what aggregating sub-nodes into a
single one brings. Here we have one node per feature, each exposing
their small feature set, with a single driver handling each. Devicetree
is longer but more straight forward, with small resource provider nodes
versus a big behemoth handling all of it. Simple and easy: my brain
has an easy time grasping it all.

What you are proposing sounds more complex, for no clear benefit to my
eyes. Can you expand on what that brings? I guess answer has been given
elsewhere in depth, so answer might just be a link to the right
resource. This is an open question, not reserved to Stephen. Thanks!

It would be a new clock referenced from DT on which we would only do
clk_set_rate(priv->clk_freq). How would it fit in the clock tree? It
wouldn't have any parent, even though in practice is it parented to an
internal Nomadik I2C clock that is not being exposed.

I thought it would be an issue to have a clock modeled as having no
parent (because its true parent is not exposed) which is a blatant lie.

So code would look like (removing reg-names as it brings nothing, and
error checking for brevity):

void __iomem *div_resources[EQC_MAX_DIV_COUNT];
unsigned int max_div_resource_index =3D 0;
const struct eqc_div *div;
struct clk_hw *parent;
void __iomem *base;
struct clk_hw *hw;

// Learn what resources should be acquired
for (i =3D 0; i < data->div_count; i++) {
	div =3D &data->divs[i];

	if (div->resource_index > max_div_resource_index)
		max_div_resource_index =3D div->resource_index;
}

// Grab resources (starting at 1 because 0 is for PLLs)
for (i =3D 1; i < max_div_resource_index; i++) {
	div_resources[i] =3D devm_platform_ioremap_resource(pdev, i);
	// TODO: error checking
}

// Register clocks
for (i =3D 0; i < data->div_count; i++) {
	div =3D &data->divs[i];
	base =3D div_resources[div->resource_index];

	parent =3D priv->cells->hws[div->parent];
	hw =3D clk_hw_register_divider_table_parent_hw(dev, div->name,
			parent, 0, base, div->shift, div->width,
			CLK_DIVIDER_EVEN_INTEGERS, NULL, NULL);
	priv->cells->hws[div->index] =3D hw;
	// TODO: error checking
}

I didn't know that beforehands. I completely get what you mean now.
Why it is that way is unclear to me but whatever. It is even documented:

dings/writing-bindings.rst#L64
