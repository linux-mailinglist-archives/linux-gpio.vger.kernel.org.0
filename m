And I never reviewed the implementation - but from the higher level
functions (wait_edge_events()) I expected that None would block, as that
is the standard Python convention.

As above, None makes more sense to me in a Python context.
I expect that anyone calling wait_edge_events() would expect that to
block, right?  It does say "wait".

Anyone currently using it will find that it is a NOP, so I doubt there
are many of those.  And the documentation needs to updated the clarify
what None does, either way.

IIWU, I'd rather fix this correctly now, rather than be explaining the
negative means blocking to Python users until the end of time.

Cheers,
Kent.
