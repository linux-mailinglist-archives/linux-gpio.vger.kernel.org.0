Let's do it as a list of pairs, but in slightly different format (I see some
potential to derive a generic parser, based on users described in
Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt), i.e.

	ignore_wake=pin:controller[,pin:controller[,...]]

I'm fine with dropping it, perhaps add a phrase to the commit message about
(safe) removal.
