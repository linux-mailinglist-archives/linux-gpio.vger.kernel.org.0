I was under the impression that the shift register has no idea
if the message is "for me", and that there can only be one shift register
on the bus if using ordinary SPI to control it.

I look at this data sheet:
https://www.farnell.com/datasheets/2030250.pdf

IIUC what you say is CS == STR?

STR (strobe) is latching out the data, and how is that happening
when you connect it to CS? CS is asserted throughout the whole
transaction...

STR is supposed to be used like in the patch: to be toggled after
the transfer is complete. CS does not behave like this at all.

Well it will work, because all values come out, however *during*
the transfer, not *after* the transfer as intended with the
STR signal.

SPI will assert CS, then make the transfer i.e. toggle the clock
a few times with new data on MOSI each clock cycle, then
de-assert CS.

STR is supposed to be toggled after all this happened to latch
out the data to the outputs, just like the patch does.

What happens if STR is connected to CS is that you will see
the shift register contents change on the output. It will be
fast so it will look fine if it is e.g. a LED. But if it is something
more sensitive, there will be chaos.

At least how I see it ...?
