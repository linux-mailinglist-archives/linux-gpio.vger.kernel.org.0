I did wrote the reset-gpio driver first ;)
then it failed the thought test on several levels.

to get a reset control one either use the shared or exclusive API.
Depending on which one you use, the behavior changes. With exclusive it
works like a GPIO (no refcounting of asserts), with shared it refcounts.

It fails flat if I boot with old dtb blob which did not had the "resets"
and "#reset-cells" (from the user's point of view). Even if the old dtb
had rst/enable/reset-gpios defined.

It is kind of hard to use it for 'Output Enable' type of gpios. They are
not reset or enable signals for the peripheral, but to open a gate to
outside, for example allow an amplifier to drive the analog line on (one
of) it's output for example.

Yep, I have checked that as well before I wrote my own gpio-reset

Even if we have a reset-gpio driver we will have the same issue that the
regulator might reset things underneath the tiddly refcounted reset line
for non regulator users, plus one extra which is using the line as
output enable.

With the gpio-shared all of these can be handled in a nice way and we
can add the pass-through mode to it which is assumed by some setups or
use refcounting as it is in the initial patch.

And we need to modify the drivers to ask for shared/nonexclusive reset/gpio.
