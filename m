Hi Greg,
I have read (and reread a couple of times)
Documentation/process/stable-kernel-rules.rst to try to understand how
to format the tags, but unfortunately it doesn't contain "Everything
you ever wanted to know about Linux -stable releases" as the title
claims :)

In particular, it doesn't explain or advise which older version we
should target, that is why since I was not sure I specified 6.1.y
because I could test it properly, but not v3.x.

Maybe it would be best to simply drop for now all the "Cc:
<stable@vger.kernel.org>" tags for this series, and following Option 2,
I send an email to stable@vger.kernel.org once the patches have been
merged to Linus' tree?

I do not understand, because my commit log message is quite long
and, it seems to me, well documenting why this works the way it
does when calling uart_configure_port() in serial_core.c?

I say that the max310x driver also does this, because there is also no
comment in the max310x driver for using the (void __iomem *)~0;
construct. I also located the original commit message for the max310x
driver but no comments were usefull there also.

So, what about adding this comment:

/*
 * Use all ones as membase to make sure uart_configure_port() in
 * serial_core.c does not abort for SPI/I2C devices where the
 * membase address is not applicable.
 */
 s->p[i].port.membase	=3D (void __iomem *)~0;


Also, keep in mind that in the original discussion about that patch,
there was the following comment from Ilpo J=E4rvinen:

------
This changelog was really well describing the problem! :-)
Yeah, some other solution should be devised. Maybe we should add
another .iotype for thse kind of devices. But I'm fine with this for
this fix. After editing the changelog, feel free to add:
Reviewed-by: Ilpo J=E4rvinen <ilpo.jarvinen@linux.intel.com>
------

If wou want, I could also add the same comment to the max310 driver?

Hugo.
