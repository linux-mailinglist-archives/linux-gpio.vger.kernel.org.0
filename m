This is contrary to what I have expected. My assumption is
that the example is some piece of code that you (and me and
other readers of the bindings documentation) can easily
understand and even copy&paste into a DTS. Like an example
in a training book. This is how I always have used the
.txt bindings when writing new DTS. This ease of use is
lost if the examples are incomplete and show only part
of what is needed to get a working DTS. If not here, where
can one get the required information from?

Or do you see this as unit-test-cases for the formal bindings
definitions? Then, it should IMHO not be named "example".

Here it is the bindings for a very specific SoC and the
register values are well defined and there is no choice at
all.

So I'll simplify it for v4 although I don't like the concept
behind.

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
