Hey Andy, Linus,
Thanks for looking at this.

The MCP23016 device is not mentioned anywhere else in this driver. The 
only place this string is used is in `struct regmap_config 
mcp23x17_regmap` (another device). It seems to me that this is a typo 
but I might be wrong.

~/w/linux$ git grep -h compatible drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-mcp23s08*
                 .compatible = "microchip,mcp23008",
                 .compatible = "microchip,mcp23017",
                 .compatible = "microchip,mcp23018",
                 .compatible = "mcp,mcp23008",
                 .compatible = "mcp,mcp23017",
                 .compatible = "microchip,mcp23s08",
                 .compatible = "microchip,mcp23s17",
                 .compatible = "microchip,mcp23s18",
                 .compatible = "mcp,mcp23s08",
                 .compatible = "mcp,mcp23s17",

Also I don't have an MC23016, so I can't test configuration for it.

I did not! I was only changing configuration for MCP23017 devices.
What have I missed?

For reference, I think you are referring to [0], [1], [2]. I'm familiar 
with the last one.

I don't think these are masks, they're addresses.

I believe the author has doubled the register indexing using a 1 bit 
shift, because the MCP23017 device is configured with sequential 
addresses (IOCON.BANK = 0). On page 12 of the datasheet [2] this looks like:

0x00 IODIRA, MCP_IODIR << 1
0x01 IODIRB
0x02 IPOLA,  MCP_IPOL << 1
0x03 IPOLB
...
0x12 GPIOA,  MCP_GPIO << 1
0x13 GPIOB

This means you can read 16 bits from MCP_GPIO << 1 and get the register 
values for both banks, or even use this for .range_min.

However, this trick doesn't work for .range_max:

	.range_max = MCP_GPIO << 1; /* 0x12 */

But I think it needs to be 0x13 to include GPIOB. Now that I'm looking 
into it, how does `mcp23x17_regmap.val_bits = 16` affect this? Perhaps 
`MCP_GPIO << 1` is fine after all.

I will whip up a v2 and test this. I'll split the changes across patches 
and fix the typo last patch - in case you don't agree with me.

Many thanks,
Thomas
