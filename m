I would like to pause here and highlight the existence of the so-called
XY problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem

| The XY problem is a communication problem encountered in help desk,
| technical support, software engineering, or customer service situations
| where the question is about an end user's attempted solution (Y) rather
| than the root problem itself (X).

You admitted that you needed to solve problem X (software reconfiguration
of the SerDes speed between 1G and 10G), and that has led you to problem
Y (giving the PLLs some refclk frequencies which aren't supported at
power-on reset, and thus, are also not validated by NXP). You've presented
to the Linux mailing lists a driver which solves problem Y, but not X.

I gave you a solution to problem X which doesn't even trigger problem Y.

Furthermore, I gave you a solution to problem Y which is much simpler
than yours. On the 12th of June, in Message-ID: 20230612163353.dwouatvqbuo6h4ea@skbuf,
I explained that if you absolutely insist to use the unsupported PLL
refclks, you can use PBL commands to change the PLL settings (so that
they lock) at power-on reset time. The advantage is that both U-Boot and
Linux will work without having to make any modification to the PLLs,
just treat them as read-only.

As it happens, at NXP we also want to solve problem X in a generic way
(aka we need a procedure that works for all customers, and not just for
your board), and we want to do so in a way that the hardware validation
team agrees with. Thus, the SoC needs to accept the PLL refclks at
power-on reset time. The solution we came up with is the one presented
to you yesterday. It makes your PLL clk driver unnecessary. No one will
come after you if you keep it in your Linux tree and use it, but it is
unnecessary.

I am waiting for someone to come up with a real life use case that
justifies those "more interesting clocking solutions".

Please correct me if you think I am wrong, but as things stand, the
SerDes PLL clk driver is now a solution waiting for a problem. It can
wait for that problem out of tree.

Out of respect for the topic at hand, ask for help in a separate thread,
open an NXP support ticket - do something to split it from the SerDes
work which it is unrelated with. You were told that part of the reason
for the NACK is the fact that you are grouping unrelated things together,
and you did nothing about it.

Ok, thanks.
