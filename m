_DDN in ACPI describes this as Virtual GPIO. The only documentation at hand
right now tells me that this is a "solution" to represent the "virtual GPIO"
as fifth community (no connection to any pads, minimum configuration, etc).

The goal as far as I can see is "to convert a PME event generated by PCI device
to a GPIO interrupt".

Seems like we better have a driver for it, but the only purpose of it is to
generate interrupts based on PME.

I'll try to dig more may be next week, but for now I would like to postpone the
patch. Do you agree?
