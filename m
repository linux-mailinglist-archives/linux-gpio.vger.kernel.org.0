I wasn't aware of this file. Thanks for pointing it out.

Why does it belong in debugfs? The whole premise of Bartosz's mail is
to provide holdouts that haven't yet migrated away from the sysfs global
number space an alternative _stable_ kernel interface they can rely on.

DebugFS is the opposite of that. It may not even be available in those
resource-constrained systems that this would be useful for.

And most importantly having the kernel keep the line requested.

The new proposal gets rid of the global numberspace all the same.

I am afraid that if we go the debugfs route, we end up with
a solution that just needs maintenance, but doesn't win users
over.

The target audience is not developers doing interactive debugging
or development. It's embedded folks having init scripts which need
GPIO lines to stay requested or software like labgrid that needs
to login to a remote host outside of its control and needs to toggle
GPIOs.

These users won't consider an unstable debugfs interface.

Thanks,
Ahmad
