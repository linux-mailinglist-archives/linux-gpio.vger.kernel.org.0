Hi, sorry for a rather delayed response,
I spent a bit of time looking at how to make the clk core be
careful with ineffective duty-cycle calls and I can't find a
nice way to do this... My idea was something like this:

static int clk_core_set_duty_cycle_nolock(struct clk_core *core,
					  struct clk_duty *duty)
{	/* ... */

	/* Update core->duty values */
	clk_core_update_duty_cycle_nolock(core);

	if ( /* duty doesn't match core->duty */ ) {
		ret = core->ops->set_duty_cycle(core->hw, duty);
	/* ... */
}

However there seem to be drawbacks to any variant of the
comparison that I could come up with:

Naive one would be to do
    if (duty->num != core->duty->num || duty->den != core->duty->den)
but it won't correctly compare e.g. 1/2 and 10/20.

Other idea was to do
    if (duty->den / duty->num != core->duty->den / core->duty->num)
but it will likely fail with very close values (e.g. 100/500 and 101/500)

I briefly thought of some more sophisticated math but I don't
like the idea of complicating this too far.

I briefly grepped the kernel sources for duty-cycle related methods
and I saw only one user of the clk_set_duty_cycle:
    sound/soc/meson/axg-tdm-interface.c
Notably it sets the cycle to 1/2 in some cases, though it seems to
be tied to the drivers/clk/meson/sclk-div.c clock driver by being
the blocks of the same SoC.

Thinking of it a bit more, I saw another approach to the problem
I want to solve: Since I just want to make developers aware of the
hardware quirk, maybe I don't need to fail the set but just put a
WARN or even WARN_ONCE there? This way the behavior will be unchanged.

Thanks,
Nikita
