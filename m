To me it is pretty much logical, yes. The providers decide themselves
if they want to have any specific device node for the chip or inherit
it from the physical hardware. Note, there are two types of the FW descriptions
of the GPIO controller, when it's 1:1 to the banks and when it's one device
with list of children, one per bank. Due to this differences we have
this field in the GPIO chip to begin with.

Which case? I'm still unsure you pictured the issue here.
Where can I read about it?
