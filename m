In a nutshell, the Rockchip io-domains handle the voltages of specific
pin-groups. I.e. mostly it is just switching between 1.8V and 3.3V .

The voltage itself is always set in a (i2c-)regulator but there is a
separate step necessary to tell the soc this information.

3.3 -> 1.8: set regulator to 1.8, tell io-domain "we're at 1.8 now"
1.8 -> 3.3: tell io-domain "3.3", set regulator to 3.3.

There is supposedly a soc-health-issue if you set the regulator to 3.3
while the io-domain thinks it's at 1.8 .


So the io-domain driver right now, just attaches to the regulator, catches
the voltage-change events and sets the io-domain setting accordingly.


What Quentin is trying to solve is a probe-dependency issue that can
happen when stuff is built into the kernel, the regulator has probed
the regulator using driver has probed, but the io.domain driver hasn't,
as that also only attached to the regulator as described above.
