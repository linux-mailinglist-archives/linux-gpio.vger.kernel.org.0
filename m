Today I find an inconsistency in drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-amd.c
so there must be a bug. As far as I can understand pinctrl-amd,
"pin_reg & ~DB_CNTRl_MASK" is used to mask out the debouncing
feature,

static int amd_gpio_set_debounce(struct gpio_chip *gc, unsigned offset,
		unsigned debounce)
{
     ...
	if (debounce) {
         ...
		if (debounce < 61) {
			pin_reg |= 1;
			pin_reg &= ~BIT(DB_TMR_OUT_UNIT_OFF);
			pin_reg &= ~BIT(DB_TMR_LARGE_OFF);
		...
		} else if (debounce < 1000000) {
			time = debounce / 62500;
			pin_reg |= time & DB_TMR_OUT_MASK;
			pin_reg |= BIT(DB_TMR_OUT_UNIT_OFF);
			pin_reg |= BIT(DB_TMR_LARGE_OFF);
		} else {
			pin_reg &= ~DB_CNTRl_MASK;
			ret = -EINVAL;
		}

	} else {
         ...
		pin_reg &= ~DB_CNTRl_MASK;
	}
     ...
}

However in amd_gpio_irq_set_type, "ping_reg & ~(DB_CNTRl_MASK << DB_CNTRL_OFF)"
is used,

static int amd_gpio_irq_set_type(struct irq_data *d, unsigned int type)
{

     ...
	case IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW:
		pin_reg |= LEVEL_TRIGGER << LEVEL_TRIG_OFF;
		pin_reg &= ~(ACTIVE_LEVEL_MASK << ACTIVE_LEVEL_OFF);
		pin_reg |= ACTIVE_LOW << ACTIVE_LEVEL_OFF;
		pin_reg &= ~(DB_CNTRl_MASK << DB_CNTRL_OFF);
		pin_reg |= DB_TYPE_PRESERVE_HIGH_GLITCH << DB_CNTRL_OFF;
		irq_set_handler_locked(d, handle_level_irq);
		break;
     ...
}

If "pin_reg & ~DB_CNTRl_MASK" is used instead, the touchpad will work
flawlessly. So I believe "pin_reg & ~DB_CNTRl_MASK" is the correct way
to mask out the debouncing filter and the bug lies in amd_gpio_set_type.

Btw, can you explain what's the difference between glitch filter and
debouncing filter? Or can you point to some references? I've gain some
experience about how to configure the GPIO controller by studying the
code of pinctrl-amd and pinctrl-baytrail (I can't find the hardware
reference manual for baytrail either). I also tweaked the configuration
in pinctrl-amd, for example, setting the debounce timeout to 976 usec
and 3.9 msec without disabling the glitch filter could also save the
touchpad. But I need some knowledge to understand why this touchpad [1]
which also uses the buggy pinctrl-amd isn't affected.
