Yes, I looked into the driver and see that it has 3 blocks of GPIOs (we call
them communities, but in the driver the term 'tiles' is used) AFAIU (correct me
if I'm wrong). And who knows how many banks in each of them.

I'm afraid that MS does on his way and not yours.

Can we have TRM for GPIO IP used there and any evidence / document from
firmware team about the implementation of the GPIO numbering in the ACPI
(at Intel we have so called BIOS Writers Guide that is given to the customers
where such info can be found)?
