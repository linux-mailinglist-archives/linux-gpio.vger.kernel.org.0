Thanks. I will explore GPIOHANDLE_REQUEST_ACTIVE_LOW to see if we can use this.

Again I wanted to highlight that the intention of the patch was to make it generic and avoid changes in userspace for different hardware samples. (i.eÂ  Some pins in hardware be configured as active low, this can vary between hardware samples. User application uses gpio-line-name property to map pins and port, this helps the application to handle pin change from hardware sample to sample. As of now there is no configuration available for user space applications for polarity.)

I also wanted to know if there are any security concerns with the patch sent.


Thanks,

Harish
