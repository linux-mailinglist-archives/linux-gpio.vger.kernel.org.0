Technically you said "no boolean flags". And I think it's pretty common
to have this type of flag bitmask to change the behavior of functions. 0
is typically considered as the "run normally" case where you don't
really have to care.

Granted, the normal case isn't made any easier with "0" than with
"false", but certainly the cases where we do pass one or more flags are
now much easier to understand.

To avoid further back and forth, what exactly is it that you would have
me do? That is, what do you consider to be the correct way to do this?

Would you prefer me to add another function with a different name that
reimplements the functionality only with the exception? Something along
the lines of:

	int driver_deferred_probe_check_state_continue(struct device *dev)
	{
		int ret;

		ret =3D driver_deferred_probe_check_state(dev);
		if (ret =3D=3D -ENODEV)
			return -EPROBE_DEFER;

		return ret;
	}

? I'd need to split that up some more to avoid the warning that the
inner function prints before returning -ENODEV, but that's a minor
detail. Would that API be more to your liking?
