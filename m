The collection of struct line always has to be global, right, as both
gpio_chardev_data and linereq are ephemeral.  e.g. if one process requests
a line and another checks the lineinfo, those will have distinct
gpio_chardev_data.

But the key issue is that the linereq and struct line lifetimes are
strictly tied - a struct line does not live beyond the containing linereq.
Leaving the struct line alive after the linereq is released is just wrong.
The line has been released back to gpiolib so there can be no
supplemental info left.
If you want any such info to persist beyond the line release then it
should be located in gpiolib itself, not cdev.

Cheers,
Kent.
