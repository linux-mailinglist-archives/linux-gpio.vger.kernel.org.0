I'm not getting what you mean by "firmware should know better"? So,
basically, and let's take OF as example, you can request a GPIO in OF
by doing something like:

	foo-gpios =3D <&gpio 1 GPIO_PULL_UP>;

In this way, when the consumer driver gets the gpio, all the flags will
be properly set so that when we set a direction (for example) the
gpiochip's 'set_config()' will be called and the driver does what it
needs to setup the pull-up. If we want BIAS_DISABLED on the pin,
there's no way to the same as the above. So basically, this can ever
happen:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c#L2227

(only possible from the gpiochip cdev interface)

So, what I'm proposing is to be possible to do from OF:

	foo-gpios =3D <&gpio 1 GPIO_PULL_DISABLE>;

And then we will get into the gpiochip's 'set_config()' to disable the
pull-up or pull-down.

As I said, my device is an input keymap that can export pins as GPIOs
(to be consumed by gpio_keys). The pins by default have pull-ups that
can be disabled by doing a device i2c write. I'm just trying to use the
infrastructure that already exists in gpiolib (for pull-up|down) to
accomplish this. There's no pinctrl driver controlling the pins. The
device itself controls them and having this device as a pinctrl one is
not really applicable.
