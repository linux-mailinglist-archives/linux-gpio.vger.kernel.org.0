That is what this patch does.

Fundamentally, the pin muxings are known a priori from the reference
manual. Because pinmuxing itself has been delegated to the PMU firmware,
we defer to it when determining what muxings are available. The PMU
firmware describes muxings in terms of pins and functions; groups are a
Linux-only concept.

No. We have to support it anyway for compatibility, so there is no point
in changing everything for no reason.

Well, perhaps you should have reviewed the original driver more
closely.

I see no point in creating thousands of groups for every combination of
pin muxings when we could just switch to the solution in this (or v2 of)
patch. For compatibility we cannot be rid of the old situation, but we
can at least fix it. There is no technical problem with them coexisting.
