Hi Rob, thanks a lot for the hint, I hope we can finally find a solution
on how to implement this.

In Documentation the block is called GPIO Controller. As explained it does
expose pinctrl function AND pwm (with regs in the middle)

Is this semplification really needed? It does pose some problem driver
wise (on where to put the driver, in what subsystem) and also on the
yaml side with mixed property for pinctrl and pwm controller.

I feel mixing the 2 thing might cause some confusion on the 2 block
device that are well separated aside from the unlucky position of the
regs.

The suggested MFD implementation would consist of
- main node with MFD (map the entire GPIO controller regs)
-   2 child for PWM and pinctrl (no regs)

- driver in mfd/
- driver in pinctrl/
- driver in pwm/

An alternative is the previous solution with pinctrl mapping all the
GPIO controller regs and PWM a child but Conor suggested that a MFD
structure might be better suited for the task. We have both implemented
and ready to be submitted. Hope we can find a common decision on how to
implement this simple but annoying block of devices.
