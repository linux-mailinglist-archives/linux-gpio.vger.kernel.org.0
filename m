I'm not dismissing it, but I want to wait for an actual user
for it :)

What bothers me with your approach is that you are returning
an integer and in one case you are interpreting it as gpio
direction and in the other case you are interpreting it as
a gpio state, while mine is more explicit, i.e. a
xlate_direction() for the direction and if there will be
support for multi bit input/output then there would be a
xlate_state() or similar. Granted, it is more code, but
easier to understand IMHO.
