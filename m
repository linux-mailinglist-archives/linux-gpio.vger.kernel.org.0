Hello My Dear.

Please do not feel disturbed for contacting  you, based on the
critical condition I find mine self, though, it's not financial
problem, but my health, you might have know that cancer is not what to
talk home about, I am married to Mr. Shine Zuthimalin who worked with
Tunisia embassy in Burkina Faso for nine years before he died in the
year 2012.We were
married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief
illness that lasted for five days.

Since his death I decided not to remarry, When my late husband was
alive he deposited the sum of US$ 9.2m (Nine million two hundred
thousand dollars) in a bank in Burkina Faso, Presently this money is
still in bank. And My Doctor told me that I don't have much time to
live because of the cancer problem, Having known my condition I
decided to hand you over this fond to take care of the less-privileged
people, you will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct
herein. I want you to take 30 Percent of the total money for your
personal use While 70% of the money will go to charity" people and
helping the orphanage.

 I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by the Government. I
grew up as an Orphan and I don't have anybody as my family member,

Regards,
Mrs. Shahinaz Zuthimalin .
