that is asking for trouble, indeed.

the only way to achieve this that I can think of is to basically have
xhci-pci-etron implement it's own pci_driver and then call
xhci_pci_probe, xhci_pci_remove, etc.
but then it depends on the driver load order if the GPIO controller is exposed

what structure did you have in mind to achieve this?

my approach from above unfortunately would not achieve this
so if you have an idea how to achieve this (or have any other driver
in mind that I can use as reference, even if not related to
GPIO/USB/PCI then please let me know)

> OpenWrt support optional modules to be compiled per-system.
that I already found out. That's why I think that I need to get the
driver part "right" and then get the OpenWrt part done in just a few
lines of their build-system
