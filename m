The goal of this series is to cover the delay of the RC filter on the
signal between the GPIO controller and the GPIO consumer.

The circuit we're looking at is

  +----------+           +-----------+
  | SoC      |           |    VCC    |
  |          |           |     |     |
  |          |           |     _     |
  |          |           |    | | R  |
  |          |           |    |_|    |
  |          |           |     |     |
  |      [IOx|-----+-----|EN]--+     |
  |          |     |     |           |
  |          |     |     | SN65DSI83 |
  +----------+    --- C  +-----------+
                  ---
		   |
		   -
		  GND

The IOx pin is an open-drain output, the board has a 470nF capacitor to
ground, and the SN65DSI83 has an internal pull-up off 200kÎ©. This gives
an RC time constant of 94ms, far from being negligible.

The delay is caused by the combination of the open-drain nature of the
output (an intrinsic property of the GPIO controller), the pull-up
resistor (an intrinsic property of the SN65DSI83) and the capacitor on
the line (a property of the board). DT is notoriously bad at modelling
this kind of setup.

Note that we would have a similar issue with a GPIO controller that
would drive the signal actively and a consumer without an internal
pull-up if the board had an RC filter on the line.

Alexander started with a patch that added a ti,enable-delay-us property
to the SN65DSI83 DT binding. I don't think that's a good idea, as the
issue is far from being specific to the SN65DSI83, patching all GPIO
consumers as needed to support signal propagation delays doesn't scale.
Patching every GPIO controller driver would be equally bad. I've thus
proposed modelling this with a standard property on the GPIO provider
side, handled by gpiolib, to have a centralized solution.

The alternative I proposed, adding a "GPIO delay" DT node to model this,
would also offer a centralized solution to the problem, but with
additional complexity both at probe time and runtime.

The regulator delays model the intrinsic delays when enabling or
disabling a regulator, and they should stay. They address a different
problem.
