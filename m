Ok, that is fair.

I was actually thinking the same thing. I think we should discuss going this route
(ACPI button driver to call the GPIO controller IRQ handler) with Rafael.

We can use the existing acpi_notifier_call_chain() mechanism and:

1. Have the button code call acpi_notifier_call_chain() on the PNP0C0C
event on button presses.

2. Have the AMD pinctrl driver register a notifier_block with
register_acpi_notifier() and then check if the source is a PNP0C0C
device based on the device_class of the acpi_bus_event struct
passed to the notifier and if it is check if GPIO0 needs
clearing.

I think this is preferable over the DMI quirk route, because this should
fix the same issue also on other affected models which we don't know
about.

Regards,

Hans
