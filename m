No. Allwinner actually names their pins like this, kind of like Rockchip
which provides standardized names such as "GPIO0_B2", but unlike MediaTek
which just names the pins after their designated primary function such as
"EINT22" or "TDM_BCLK". The ball names are a separate thing.

Even though the pin names seem a bit random, there's actually a grouping
logic underneath:

- PC pins are always for the bootable internal storage (NAND, SPI-NOR, eMMC=
)
- PF pins are always the external SD card / debug UART / JTAG

No. i2c0 is the actual peripheral that gets muxed in. The SDA / SCL
comments are simply denoting which signal from the peripheral this
pin & mux value carry.
