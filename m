Not sure which of those memory regions are actually accessible on this
board, but honestly I don't even want to try accessing it. Blowing fuses
is not my wish there ;)

On downstream the node is just described like the following:

	qfprom: qfprom@780000 {
		compatible =3D "qcom,qfprom";
		reg =3D <0x780000 0x7000>;
		...
	};

So we have 0x780000 - 0x786fff here.

In sc7280.dtsi we have the following:

	qfprom: efuse@784000 {
		compatible =3D "qcom,sc7280-qfprom", "qcom,qfprom";
		reg =3D <0 0x00784000 0 0xa20>,
			  <0 0x00780000 0 0xa20>,
			  <0 0x00782000 0 0x120>,
			  <0 0x00786000 0 0x1fff>;
		...
	};

So I guess this:
* 0x780000 - 0x780a1f
* 0x782000 - 0x78211f
* 0x784000 - 0x784a1f
* 0x786000 - 0x787ffe

So at least the last memory region seems to be partially out of range
according to downstream.

So after reading all of this I tried running this commmand on the phone
and the phone reboots into 900e mode.

  $ cat /sys/devices/platform/soc@0/784000.efuse/qfprom0/nvmem

I guess normally this should work? So if I interpret this correctly, the
Linux driver thinks it can access more than it can/should. But also
should probably try this command on another chipset to see if it works
on any really?
