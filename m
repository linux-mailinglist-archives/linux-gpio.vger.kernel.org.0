Actually there are only two styles:
 - this one (as updated version) for entire kernel with the exception of
 - net / network one (as you used originally)

Alphabetical. When you don't see a direct answer the rule of thumb is
to go to the recent contributions and check a few new drivers to see
how they are doing.

So that reviewers are right and maybe wrong (see below for the
details), I don't see those reviews so I can't judge.

Have you checked how deep and sudden the header inclusion went?

Of course and it's wrong in your case. No header from above guarantees
that. See below.

> Need I add <linux/of.h> or other inclusions back?

The rule of thumb is that you have to include all headers you are a
direct user of.
There are some that guarantee inclusion of others, like
bits.h is always included if you use bitmap.h  (via bitops.h) or
compiler_attributes.h is always provided by types.h.

You have to find a golden ratio here (yes, it's kinda knowledge that
doesn't come at once, needs to have some experience).

Yes, and it's exactly what has been suggested. It's a C standard
allowed trick. With the -O2 compiler gives you the same code for both
(at least on x86).

I don't know. You need to answer this question, it's your code. And
you know how it's supposed to be used etc, etc.

No, it's harder to read and easy to mistake what the base and / or

It's an idea that is used in zillions of the drivers (and not via macros).

static inline spp_readl(struct ... *spp, u32 offset)
{
  return readl(...);
}

Same for _writel() and so on.

Since it's a pin control driver, the pin control debug callback can
show this. For GPIO I would rather not be bothered with not requested
pins. But it's your decision.

Yes, I put blank lines around the dup and left context (as a first
line) to show why the second one is a dup. When you miss something,
read the implementation code. It's open source at the end!

I wouldn't expect these to be in the production-ready driver. And
since you are committing to drivers/pinctrl and not to drivers/staging
I consider that you are trying to push this code as production-ready.

As the first step, the second one is to remove 90%+ of these messages
as I explained above.

Fine, can you reuse some library functions, etc? Please, consider
refactoring to make it more readable.

Do your homework, it's not me who makes this contribution :-)
Hint: something about multiplication.

What error handling? You have the same point which does the same for
them, I don't see duplication avoidance. See below as well.

Ah, now I even may say that the above assignment is simply wrong.
It's not designed for what you think it's for. Use different ways.

And there is no value in this information.

Neither in this case.

Explain the point "why?". In general you have to explain each line of
your code "why are you doing this or that?".

What do you mean by this in this case. This is a clear miss of bits.h
here as you use macros from it. Imagine if you include this file
somewhere where bits.h hasn't found its mysterious ways.

So what? It doesn't mean the code is bad in one way or another, :-)

To avoid the churn in the future when it will be expanded. Believe I
saw this kind of "proves" that this or that won't ever be expanded and
then... you may picture what happens.

> If we add extra comma, the array will have one more element.

Yes, with touching the "last" one here. Please, add commas where it's
not a crystal clear a termination (which is not in many cases, usually
arrays with NULL entry or enums with MAX value at the end).
