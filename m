Why not? You always can have internal opaque data structure that takes constant
object from the provider.

I see it clearly that we don't need to go this dead end.
The fwnode used by GPIO devices is not semantically the same as fwnode that is
supplied by the provider. Moreover, your patch will bring a clear layering
violation since it changes the member behind the owner's back.

No, please do not do this hack with fwnode.
