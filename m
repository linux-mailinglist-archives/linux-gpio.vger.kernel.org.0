There is. Software node is not firmware node, their lifetime is the same or
wider than the respective device (often, they are statically defined without
any device in mind).

The whole concept of a single linked list with limitation to up to two
nodes and being the part of the struct fwnode_handle itself appears to
be problematic. We have a lot of tricks here and there instead of properly
having a list head in the struct device without any limitations in number
of nodes with a priority based on the appearance in the list.

For the details you may ask USB DWC3 developers and related to that.

Is there any _good_ documentation for devlinks and all that fields in the
struct fwnode? Why should we use that without any understanding of the
purposes of that field. We, as device property developers, hadn't introduced
that field and never required it. It's an alien to device properties APIs.
