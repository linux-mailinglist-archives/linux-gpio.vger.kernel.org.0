Don't we already have a "saved parent" field by storing the pointer to
the clk_hw?

>=20

Let me say this another way. Why does this driver want to know the index
that the framework uses for some clk_hw pointer? Perhaps it happens to
align with the same value that hardware uses, but I still don't
understand why the driver wants to know what the framework has decided
is the index for some clk_hw pointer.

Or is this something like "give me the index for the parent that the
framework thinks I currently have but in reality don't have anymore
because the register contents were wiped and we need to reparent it"? A
generic API to get any index for this question is overkill and we should
consider adding some sort of API like clk_hw_get_current_parent_index(),
or a framework flag that tells the framework this parent is incorrect
and we need to call the .set_parent() op again to reconfigure it.
