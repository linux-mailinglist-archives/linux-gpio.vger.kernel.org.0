Good to know.

Is there an I2C mux, too? Or just the SFP signals connected to
the SGPIO? What I was seeing is that during probing of the SFPs
the SFPs EEPROM is read and when the I2C mux is controlled by the
SGPIO it will switch too late - or even worse, in the middle of
a transaction. I would speculate the timing isn't that critical
with signals just connected directly to the SFP.

In any case, I think it is pretty clear that it cannot work the
way it is right now, no? See the very next paragraph...
