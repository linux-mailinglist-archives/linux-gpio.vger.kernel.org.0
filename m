We started to handle this by overlays, but that requires to distinguish during the bootloader phase, which is hard to service and often unneeded. Especially when we want to rename a single line, the overlay needs to override all entries, which leads to duplication of those line name lists.

I don't have a problem with it in principle, though I would have to
consider the implications.

Obviously changing line names while another process is doing a name
lookup is racy, so the search could produce an unexpected result.
e.g. say you want to swap two line names, as was one of your use cases.
If the set is per line then there will be a period where one name applies
to two lines and the other applies to none.  Is that a problem?
Perhaps an operation to apply a set of changes atomically?
Or do we need to move the lookup into the kernel?
Or do we trust userspace to not do lookups while setting names?

And would the name be set through the chip or line request?
If chip, then do we need to notify the user holding the line that
the name changed?
OTOH, is requiring the user to request the line to rename it too
restrictive?

So, yeah, interesting idea that I'm not averse to, but requires some
thought as to what wrinkles it might introduce and how best to iron
them out.

Alternatively, are named lines the right solution to your problem?
Is it important to you that the lines are correctly named, or are you
just using the name for the chip/offset lookup?  If the latter perhaps
roll your own pinout lookup based on the platform configuration?

Cheers,
Kent.
