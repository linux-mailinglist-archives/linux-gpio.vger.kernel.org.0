Based on last discussion[1], I posted the V5 of the below three 
patches[2] separately. I don't mind clubbing these again back to 
Minidump series as long as three patches can be picked up separately.


>    firmware: qcom_scm: provide a read-modify-write function
>    pinctrl: qcom: Use qcom_scm_io_update_field()
>    firmware: scm: Modify only the download bits in TCSR register
