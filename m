Should be fine I think.
Again, I would trust the board design to take into consideration of the
consumer's needs when sharing the same GPIO line for any purpose.

To start with I would let GPIO core to allow requesting the same GPIO
line by multiple consumers all the time.

If the flags for the gpio_request does not contain
GPIOD_FLAGS_BIT_NONEXCLUSIVE (probably we can have another define for
BIT(4) as GPIOD_FLAGS_BIT_MIGHT_BE_SHARED?) then print with dev_warn()
to get the attention of the developer that all users of the shared GPIO
line must be checked and change the current dev_info() to dev_dbg() when
the flag is provided.

When the consumer drivers are checked (and modified if needed) that they
behave OK in this situation we can snap the
GPIOD_FLAGS_BIT_MIGHT_BE_SHARED to silence the warning.

Not sure how the core would refcount things, but to align with what Rob
was saying about the misleading API naming:
gpiod_set_value(priv->en_gpio, 1/0) against the DT's
GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH/LOW of the line's active state we might want to have:
gpiod_assert(priv->en_gpio);
gpiod_deassert(priv->en_gpio);

Basically assert would set the level to the active state defined by the
DT. deassert would, well, de-assert the active state.

gpiod_deassert() would be equivalent to Philipp's
gpiod_politely_suggest_value()

Gradually drivers can be moved to this API pair from gpiod_set_value()
when it makes sense.
The current gpiod_set_* would operate like as it is right now by not
asking politely a level, whatever it is.

Hrm, probably both gpiod_assert() and gpiod_deassert() should be polite
when asking for level change?

If all consumers of the shared line is using gpiod_assert/deassert, then
the core should 'protect' the raw level of the gpiod_assert() calls.

At the end we will see drivers converted to assert/deassert API when a
developer faces issues that they use shared GPIO line on a board.

gpiod_get should also use the polite version when setting the initial
level most likely.

Another thing is that currently gpio core does not have refcounting and
most of the client drivers treat it like that. It is perfectly fine to
gpiod_get(priv->en_gpio,1);
gpiod_get(priv->en_gpio,1);
gpiod_get(priv->en_gpio,1);
gpiod_get(priv->en_gpio,0);

at the last call the GPIO value is going to be set to 0 no matter if it
was set to 1 three times prior, but I guess this can be worked out when
the driver(s) are converted to assert/deassert.
