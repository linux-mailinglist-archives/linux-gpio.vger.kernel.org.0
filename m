Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker.

I noticed a regression report in bugzilla.kernel.org that afaics nobody
acted upon since it was reported. That's why I decided to forward it by
mail to those that afaics should handle this.

To quote from https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216371 :

See the ticket for details.

Please look into the issue if you're among the main recipients of this
mail (and not just CCed). I hope I picked the right people to sent this
to, if not, just let everyone know (and apologies!). Basavaraj, unless
my quick analysis of the situation went haywire it seems that you
recently added code with the error message noticed by the reporter.

Anyway, to ensure this is not forgotten lets get this tracked by the the
Linux kernel regression tracking bot:

#regzbot introduced: v5.19..v6.0-rc2
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216371
#regzbot ignore-activity

This isn't a regression? This issue or a fix for it are already
discussed somewhere else? It was fixed already? You want to clarify when
the regression started to happen? Or point out I got the title or
something else totally wrong? Then just reply -- ideally with also
telling regzbot about it, as explained here:
https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/tracked-regression/

Reminder for developers: When fixing the issue, add 'Link:' tags
pointing to the report in bugzilla, as the kernel's documentation calls
for; above page explains why this is important for tracked regressions.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
