The driver is already pretty hard to read because it combines so many
generations of spmi arbiter hardware from qcom into one file. It would
probably be better to start over and simplify the new version of the
driver, possibly sharing code between the two files if possible, but
otherwise dropping lots of cruft along the way and simplifying review
burden.
