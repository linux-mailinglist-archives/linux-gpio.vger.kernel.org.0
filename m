Thanks for your opinion on this, Hans.  Yeah, with the information from
Jeffrey, I now agree with Andy that these high GPIO numbers are not
broken but have some meaning, and we should map them back to real GPIO
number in Qualcomm GPIO driver.

So we reach a consensus that this is not the right solution for Lenovo
Flex 5G. But what about for Andy's Galileo Gen 2 case, where the GPIO
number in ACPI is truly broken?
