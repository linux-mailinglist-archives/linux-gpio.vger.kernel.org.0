So, documentation says the following.

  "Chassis GPIO does not support the notion of Virtual GPIOs. So a fifth GPIO
   Community was added to provide virtual GPIOs. This virtual GPIO resides
   inside PCU."

  "Table 8â€‘19: Virtual GPIO Assignments in CHV
   GPIO-V[x]	Usage
   [7]		 Reserved for PMC usage
   [6]		 PME handling
   [5]		 Reserved for PMC usage
   [4]		 OTG PME
   [3:1]	 In VLV2, was used for tx_modphy_common_mode_en.
		 In CHV, these are reserved for future use.
   [0]		 SATA PME"

IOAPIC mapping:

  "108  GPIO_virtual"


While at it, in case you want the mapping for direct IRQ:

    1) GPIO North:  eight interrupts used, connected to IOxAPIC IRQ51 to IRQ58.
    2) GPIO Southwest:  eight interrupts used, connected to IOxAPIC IRQ59 to IRQ66.
    3) GPIO East:  all sixteen interrupts used, connected to IOxAPIC IRQ67 to IRQ82.
    4) GPIO Southeast:  all sixteen interrupt used, connected to IOxAPIC IRQ92 to IRQ107.
