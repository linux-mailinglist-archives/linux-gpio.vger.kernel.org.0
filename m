I'd prefer to keep it to the current use case. I'm not sure if
there are many controllers which have more than one bit for
the input and output state. And if, we are still limited to
one register, what if the bits are distributed among multiple
registers..

It is just an internal implementation detail; I'm not talking
about changing the configuration. And actually, there was
once confusion about the reg_dir_in_base and reg_dir_out_base, IIRC.
I'd need to find that thread again. But for now, I'd keep the
configuration anyway.

Think about it. If you already have the value translation (which you
  need), why would you still do the invert inside the
{set,get}_direction? It is just a use case of the translation
function actually. (Also, an invert only makes sense with a one
bit value).

You could do something like:
if (config->reg_dir_out_base) {
    gpio->xlat_direction = gpio_regmap_simple_xlat_direction;
    gpio->reg_dir_base = config->reg_dir_out_base;
}
if (config->reg_dir_in_base) {
    gpio->xlat_direction = gpio_regmap_simple_xlat_direction_inverted;
    gpio->reg_dir_base = config->reg_dir_in_base;
}

But both of these function would be almost the same, thus my
example below.

Mhh. Actually I just noticed while writing this.. we need a new
config->reg_dir_base anyway, otherwise you'd need to either pick
reg_dir_in_base or reg_dir_out_base to work with a custom
.xlat_direction callback.

if (config->xlat_direction) {
    gpio->xlat_direction = config->gpio_xlat_direction;
    gpio->reg_dir_base = config->reg_dir_base;
}

Since there are no users of config->reg_dir_in_base, we can just kill
that one. These were just added because it was based on bgpio. Then
it will just be:

gpio->reg_dir_base = config->reg_dir_base;
gpio->direction_xlat = config->direction_xlat;
if (!gpio->direction_xlat)
   gpio->direction_xlat = gpio_regmap_simple_direction_xlat;

If someone needs an inverted direction, he can either have a custom
direction_xlat or we'll introduce a config->invert_direction option.

Yes. I was thinking it isn't an issue because the driver implementing 
this
will need to know the mask anyway. But maybe it is better to also pass
the mask, which was obtained by the .reg_mask_xlat(). Or we could just
repeat the corresponding value within the value and the caller could
also apply the mask to this returned value.

I.e. if you have a two bit value 01 for output and 10 for input and
you have a 32bit register with 16 values, you can use
  *dir_out = 0x55555555;
  *dir_in = 0xaaaaaaaa;

Not that easy to understand. But maybe you find it easier than me
to write documentation ;)
