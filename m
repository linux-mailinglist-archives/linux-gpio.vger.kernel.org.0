Sorry about the slow reply. Been a bit busy.

Oh, this is not true though. With the example binding I gave,
fw_devlink will automatically defer the probe of devices that depend
on pins that need an iodomain/regulator.

pinctrl {
    compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3568-pinctrl";
    i2c0 {
                /omit-if-no-ref/
                i2c0_xfer: i2c0-xfer {
                        rockchip,pins =3D
                                /* i2c0_scl */
                                <0 RK_PB1 1 &pcfg_pull_none_smt>,
                                /* i2c0_sda */
                                <0 RK_PB2 1 &pcfg_pull_none_smt>;
                };
    }
    ...
    ...
    pinctrl-io {
        compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3568-pinctrl-io";
        pmuio1-supply =3D <&vcc3v3_pmu>;
        cam {
            ....
        }
        ....
        ....
}

consumerA {
   pinctrl-0 =3D <&cam>;
}

With this model above, there are no cycles anymore.

pictrl doesn't depend on anything.
vcc3v3_pmu will depend on pinctrl (not shown in DT above).
pinctrl-io depends on pinctrl and vcc3v3_pmu.
consumerA depends on pinctrl-io.

So pinctrl probes first.
vcc3v3 will probe next.
pinctrl-io will probe now that the supply is ready.
consumerA will probe now that pinctrl-io is ready.

fw_devlink will enforce all these dependencies because it understands
pinctrl and -supply bindings.
