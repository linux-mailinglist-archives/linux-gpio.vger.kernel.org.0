The GRF_CHIP_ID reg (0xFF000800) can be used to identify what model is
used at runtime:

RK3308: 0xCEA (errata: chip id value is 32'h0cea (32'd3306))
RK3308B: 0x3308
RK3308BS: 0x3308C

Vendor U-Boot make use of this reg to identify what model is running:
https://github.com/rockchip-linux/u-boot/blob/next-dev/arch/arm/include/asm/arch-rockchip/cpu.h#L68-L82

I can only validate on real hw that the reg value is 0x3308 for RK3308B.

Jonas
