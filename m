Note, besides above reasons the one is (was in this case as you noticed)
to wait until dependencies laid down in the upstream.

This part of the kernel is not so critical as scheduler, but in general I agree
that sooner we get this in is better. The other thing, that we have 3 regressions
now for very this code. And some of them are still under discussions.

Wouldn't be better to gather all fixes and send a bunch via proper process
after rc1? This will ensure that everything we know about is covered properly
and processed accordingly,

In broader way, the process should be amended if you want a fast track for
the patches like this. I'm on the second level here, Bart is the maintainer
who sends PRs directly to Linus. Do we have anything like this?

Ideally I should be able to create a tag based on an (arbitrary) commit from
vanilla that is in the time of merge window and send it directly to Linus
(with the respective maintainer's Ack). That's what I call a fast track.
Maybe you can introduce and document a such?
