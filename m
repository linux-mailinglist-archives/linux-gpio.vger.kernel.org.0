One more thing, though. I think those warnings are incomplete or actually
reversed, and we outta use WARN_ON(IS_ERR(desc)), no?

This way it will fix my concerns and your concerns will be satisfied, right?
So, if gpiod_get() returns an error pointer and then we are trying to
free it with GPIOLIB=n, _then_ we will got a warning and it's obvious that
driver has to be prepared for that, otherwise if we have it NULL and
call for gpiod_get_optional(), even with GPIOLIB=n, it's fine to free, we
don't care.
