Well, devicetree overlays also have some benefits. Particularly that it

is an open standard, and can be shared with ZephyrRTOS, if done properly.

The syntax itself is not particularly hard, and it isn't difficult to

create tools to make creating device trees easier.


The current compiler errors are not great to be honest, but that is

mostly due to the fact the barrier to entry for end users is quite

high (go u-boot route or modify the current device tree) instead of

sysfs APIs which other tools can interact with to generate overlays

on the fly. In short, if the kernel provides a userspace API, the

development on compiler and other userspace tools side can make

the process much simpler.

I don't think many people will directly write devicetree overlays,

but generating them is not difficult since it is a defined standard.

Can't really comment on ACPI since have not interacted with that much.

Well, any solution we come up with, has to be for endusers

and not just a developer interface. I have suggested

maybe locking down the dt overlays to some specific

nodes which need to be declared in devicetree [0], but I am

not the maintainer of the subsystem, so many people need

to agree there, but let's see.


Btw, I do agree that there should be a sysfs based API for GPIO.

It's quite a pain when you want to not have external dependencies.

I have used the `ioctl` based API directly, but even then you end

up depending on libc (and ioctl signature is different between musl

and glibc). Additionally, all the structures and error handling just

builds up.
