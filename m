It has similarities and differences. In your case you need to have somewhere
some piece of the code that will do proper things, but it shouldn't be GPIO
ACPI layer.

Platform is a combination of hardware, PCB and uC firmwares. AFAIU that
platform was never designed for use in Linux, correct? So, it is not the same
as any other platform on the same SoC.

No, they are not broken. They have a specific (Windows way) meaning. There is
no quirk implied.
