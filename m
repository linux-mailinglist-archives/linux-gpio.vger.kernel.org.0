FYI, I have sent out a series that ports the IO domain driver to U-Boot.
This was needed to have working Ethernet on RK356x devices that use a
1.8V PHY. Initially only RK356x support have been ported but support for
other SoCs should follow in the future. Vendor U-Boot also initialize
the IO domain configuration based on the voltage reported by the
supplying regulator.

So at least for the example board IO domains should be configured when
entering linux while booting using a future version of mainline U-Boot.
