You could look at it that way.

Yeah, I realised that when I went to implement it :(.

What I implemented was to read the line info and build the config from that.
So no impact on core.
Not the most efficient, but for this use case I wan't fussed.

At the end of the day you are the arbiter of where that line is drawn, so
that is up to you.

Oh, you would be surprised - the C++ "one-liners" are still considered

That sounds good to me.

Sorry, still haven't had a chance to look at the GLib API.
But if it involves any additional overhead or learning curve then it
wont be well received.
