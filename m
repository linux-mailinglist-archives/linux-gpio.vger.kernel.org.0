NO! See below. But basically NAK for implementing a separate bindings
and separate DP PHY driver. Also you can't just leave old platforms. All
of them have the same hardware, so all these platforms can be updated
simultaneously.

The same PHY is present on SM6115 / SM4250 / QRB4210 and QCM2290 /
QRB2210, but those platforms don't seem to have a proper DisplayPort,
only the DP PHY as a part of this block. Please try gaining access to
the documents and make a design decision rather than making an ad-hoc
solutions.

Is there any software or hardware connection between primary and
secondary USB3 PHYs? It doesn't seem so.

currently? Can it be used in any other way?

This is the case for the particular board, not for the platform itself.

Are you saying that those two registers are really independent? Well...
That might make sense as the two PHYs are mostly independent.

Having the global reset means that there should be one driver handling
both PHYs.

What should we do during orientation switch? During the change between
native USB over USB-C and DP-over-USB-C? Please provide full
information, not the limited set.

As I wrote earlier, change USBC driver to provide either two PHYs
simultaneously or just one PHY and a way to switch modes on the fly
(personally I think that two PHYs better match the USBC PHY hardware and
the normal Combo PHY design).

Do we need to program this DP PHY differently for the DP-native and
DP-over-USB-C cases?
