The job of the nexus node would be to translate a generic request for
a numbered resource to a specific request for an RP1 resource with
arbitrary properties. The arbitrary properties could be GPIO offsets,
which are board specific, while the node supplying the resource is
provided by the overlay. This means that an entry in the table,
described by a single property, could have contributions from the base
DT and the overlay, which is not possible since overlays overwrite
whole properties.

Perhaps that particular problem could be overcome by creating a
single-entry map, using the map-mask feature to pass through all of
the GPIO offset and flags to the parent, so that the whole table
becomes a proxy for RP1's GPIO controller. Is that what you had in
mind?

Fortunately for me I'm not arguing _for_ the use of an overlay.

I think I can see how that could be made to work for GPIOs. It looks
as though the GPIO subsystem is the only one making use of
of_parse_phandle_with_args_map. Interrupts seem to have an open-coded
equivalent, and iommus. What about I2C and PWM?
