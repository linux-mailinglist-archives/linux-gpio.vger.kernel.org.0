Actually, most of the devices could work by chance. If you have any IO 
domain running at anything but the default value (3V3 on PX30 and 
RK3399), it won't work until configured by the IO domain driver.

If the IO domain driver is probed before the device requiring it is 
probed, it'll work flawlessly.

Also, we actually hit this issue because the camera driver (ov5675.c) is 
doing an i2c transfer in its probe function. I assume devices where no 
interaction with the device is required during probe (e.g. no 
I2C/SPI/whatever transfer or clock enabling) of the driver, will also 
work just fine if their subsystem don't call callbacks before the IO 
domain device is probed.

So, I think it mostly work by luck today.

Might also be thanks to "custom" bootloaders (our upstream U-Boot does 
it already for another IO domain) setting this up before Linux boots.

If you say so :) This patch has no knowledge of it and does not require 
it, it just makes sure it probes the IO domain devices before any device 
use the pins.

That would have been my hope yes, but it is not possible for one of the 
boards we have based on PX30.

All pinmux listed in the px30.dtsi today belong to an IO domain. This 
includes the I2C pins for the bus on which the PMIC is.
Adding the rockchip,io-domains on each pinctrl will create the following 
circular dependency:
pinctrl depends on the io-domain device which depends on
regulators from a PMIC on i2c which requires the i2c bus pins to be
muxed from the pinctrl

Since the PMIC powering the IO domains can virtually be on any I2C bus, 
we cannot add it to the main SoC.dtsi, it'll need to be added per board 
sadly.

The RFC mail contains a bit more info about the pitfalls and what's 
needed to use it.

In your board dts(i) :/

This would probably be what's required for PCIe to work on our Puma 
Haikou (I tested this patchset for a camera extension board, which isn't 
upstreamed yet, nor mass-produced):

Considering that the deferred probing mechanism is to retry the 
to-be-deferred device after all other devices have been tried, it is 
very likely to not spam dmesg.

We could remove it though, no strong opinion on this.

Of course (at least that's the intent). If it is omitted, 
of_parse_phandle will return NULL and we'll not be executing this part 
of the code. However, if one phandle is provided and the device does not 
actually exist (IIUC, the phandle points to a DT-valid node but the 
device pointed at by the phandle is either disabled or its driver is not 
built). That being said, I don't know how this would work with an IO 
domain driver built as a module. That would be a pretty dumb thing to do 
though.

Nothing prevents you from trying it out right now :)

I might be tempted to resend it in a few weeks as v1 to force a 
discussion since this isn't really getting the attention I'd like it to 
receive (and we really need it, though we can work around all this and 
do it in the bootloader). Well.. it's also summer and people usually 
take long holidays or are busy with life :)

Thanks for the review, looking forward to having people use this.

Cheers,
Quentin
