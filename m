Manikanta's patch (f56914393537 "gpio: zynq: fix zynqmp_gpio not an
immutable chip warning") did many things at once, the move to the
generic resource handlers was just one of the changes. I can only guess
that it intended to simply the code a bit, and the dropped pm runtime
detail was just an oversight.

Enabling the pm runtime is necessary on my boards, at least for level
IRQs. Edge IRQs are still handled fine, interestingly.


Thanks,
Daniel
