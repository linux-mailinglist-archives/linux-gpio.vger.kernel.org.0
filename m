Then, how are those two devices identified in a device tree?
That is the point in Peng's case and why he wants to have a dedicated
protocol id (I don't agree to this, though.)
If we follow Cristian's idea, we may want to have two dt nodes, say
pinctrl-scmi-generic and pinctrl-scmi-imx, as phandles for other device
nodes to refer to pins, respectively.
I think there is currently no mechanism (or binding?) to allow this
except adding a protocol id.
