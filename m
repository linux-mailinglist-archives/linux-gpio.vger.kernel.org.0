Agree with file descriptors not being ideal for this, but what other
options are there?

The unread event can't disappear from the fifo. The fifo is write only
from the kernel side, right?

You are right that things don't go well if userspace doesn't strictly
follow the read from fd then LINEINFO ioctl ordering.

So probably best to keep things simple.

And we should accept that overflows may occur.  As that would leave
userspace with stale info, userspace should poll the LINEINFO ioctl
occassionally to check that it is still in sync.

Tarring it with the sysfs brush is a bit harsh!
You are comparing apples and oranges.
In the sysfs case the problem was losing events.
In this case losing events is not critical.

I believe the previous proposal was yours - adding watch and unwatch
ioctls to the chip fd.
