Yes, thanks, that current inflation of SoC variants is what I was
concerned about.

Have you checked whether the CAN peripheral registers are there, on the D1?

Is there any chance you can add the "MACH_SUN8I || " already?
Not that it is really surprising, but I explicitly compared the pin mux
overview tables of the R528(ARMv7) and D1(RISC-V) manuals, and they are
identical. So we just use the D1 compatible string as a fallback for the
R528 and T113 parts, in which case the driver should be build for ARM, too.

Cheers,
Andre
