So, I looked closer to the issue you are trying to describe here.

As far as I understand we have 4 state of BIAS in the hardware:
1/ AS IS (defined by firnware)
2/ Disabled (neither PU, not PD)
3/ PU
4/ PD

The case when the default of bias is not disabled (for example specific, and I
think very special, hardware may reset it to PD or PU), it's a hardware driver
responsibility to inform the framework about the real state of the lines and
synchronize it.

Another case is when the firmware sets the line in non-disabled state and
by some reason you need to disable it. The question is, why?

Since this provides a GPIO chip, correct?, it's responsibility of the driver to
synchronize it, no? Basically if you really don't trust firmware, you may
go via all GPIO lines and switch them to the known (in software) state. This
approach on the other hand is error prone, because firmware should know better
which pin is used for which purpose, no? If you don't trust firwmare (in some
cases), then it's a matter of buggy platform that has to be quirked out.
