I'm asking if there is any device with these tables on market?

Just a side note I forgot in previous reply: The tables themselves look good in
my opinion.

Yes. in this case it's not needed. Only case when it might if you have a bunch
of platforms where a few GpioInt() resources are present and they have no
mapping. This will help to figure out what resource is related to what IRQ
line. Overall it's not bad decision to add one.

Wait, what you are telling is that the GpioInt() resource is a dup for one of
Interrupt() resource. Is it correct interpretation?

Yes, but why do you need to know this pin in software?

Properties make sense when there is no standard ACPI approach or it lacks of
some information. As far as I can tell here the properties is better, but I
would like to understand first the need for this information in the first place
(see above comment).

This sounds strange to me. What you are telling is that there is no hw register
from which you may retrieve this information? So it's a workaround of silicon
bug?

Any comments on this? Do you have a GPIO driver available?
