Ah, that would explain why I was scratching my head trying to understand
how exactly this was supposed to work. It did feel like there was some
infrastructure there, but looking around there wasn't a very consistent
usage pattern that I could find.

I think suspend/resume is always a little tricky. For example the clocks
may required a slightly different logical sequences between SoCs. Maybe
even different types of clocks have different needs. We seem to have a
bit of that on Tegra alone already. Without having delved into this too
much, it seems to me like the core can't do a whole lot without stepping
(potentially) on drivers' toes.

The current save_context/restore_context seems to be mostly that,
though, so I think it's a good starting point. You're right that we may
eventually see clearer patterns appear.

Okay, great. I'll go replace the above patch in the branch that I have.
I'm not sure if you saw it, but I had sent this in a pull request for
v5.5-rc1 about a week ago because I've got Tegra clock driver patches
that depend on this. I can replace this patch with the above proposal
and update the Tegra clock driver branch and then resend the two pull
requests.

Does that sound like a plan?
