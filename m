Well it is kernel code, so yeah.

So you use transitional states - not just requested/freed.
Before the gc->request() call gpiod_request_commit() marks the desc as
being requested (while it holds the appropriate lock of course).
If the gpiod_free_commit() comes along and sees that mark, again while
holdiing the lock, then it marks the desc as to be freed and leaves it
for gpiod_request_commit() to cleanup.
When gpiod_request_commit() re-acquires the lock after the gc->request()
call it sees the to be freed mark and performs the cleanup instead of the
commit finalisation.

I'm generalising here and not looking at code, so the specifics may be
wrong, but this is a solvable problem.

That is a very different problem - another breach of contract, or lack
of contract. And a problem that can't be solved by changing the locks.

And that is the actual problem here - the lack of contracts.

This is why I advocate for not holding any locks during the callbacks -
then there are no restrictions imposed on the driver and no way it can
inadvertantly deadlock.

So why allow the usage of non-requested descriptors?
