If it's missing it's easy to inject entire block from EFI variable or using
ConfigFS (see meta-acpi project [1] for details).

Yes, if you override entire DSDT it can be fixed for many bugs at once.

Perhaps above mentioned project somehow can be extended to keep DSDT ASL code
for overriding? Mika?
