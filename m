Subject: [PATCH RESEND v2] dt-bindings: pinctrl: Convert ingenic,pinctrl.txt to YAML
Date:   Mon, 22 Jun 2020 13:37:40 +0200
Message-Id: <20200622113740.46450-1-paul@crapouillou.net>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: linux-gpio-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-gpio.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-gpio@vger.kernel.org

Convert the ingenic,pinctrl.txt doc file to ingenic,pinctrl.yaml.

In the process, some compatible strings now require a fallback, as the
corresponding SoCs are pin-compatible with their fallback variant.

Signed-off-by: Paul Cercueil <paul@crapouillou.net>

Notes:
    v2: - Use 'pinctrl' instead of 'pin-controller' as the node name
        - remove 'additionalProperties: false' since we will have pin conf nodes

-Ingenic XBurst pin controller
-
-Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
-common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
-phrase "pin configuration node".
-
-For the XBurst SoCs, pin control is tightly bound with GPIO ports. All pins may
-be used as GPIOs, multiplexed device functions are configured within the
-GPIO port configuration registers and it is typical to refer to pins using the
-naming scheme "PxN" where x is a character identifying the GPIO port with
-which the pin is associated and N is an integer from 0 to 31 identifying the
-pin within that GPIO port. For example PA0 is the first pin in GPIO port A, and
-PB31 is the last pin in GPIO port B. The jz4740, the x1000 and the x1830
-contains 4 GPIO ports, PA to PD, for a total of 128 pins. The jz4760, the
-jz4770 and the jz4780 contains 6 GPIO ports, PA to PF, for a total of 192 pins.
-
-
-Required properties:
---------------------
-
- - compatible: One of:
-    - "ingenic,jz4740-pinctrl"
-    - "ingenic,jz4725b-pinctrl"
-    - "ingenic,jz4760-pinctrl"
-    - "ingenic,jz4760b-pinctrl"

-    - "ingenic,x1000e-pinctrl"
-    - "ingenic,x1500-pinctrl"
-    - "ingenic,x1830-pinctrl"
- - reg: Address range of the pinctrl registers.
-
-
-Required properties for sub-nodes (GPIO chips):
------------------------------------------------
-
- - compatible: Must contain one of:
-    - "ingenic,jz4740-gpio"
-    - "ingenic,jz4760-gpio"
-    - "ingenic,jz4770-gpio"
-    - "ingenic,jz4780-gpio"
-    - "ingenic,x1000-gpio"
-    - "ingenic,x1830-gpio"
- - reg: The GPIO bank number.
- - interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
- - interrupts: Interrupt specifier for the controllers interrupt.
- - #interrupt-cells: Should be 2. Refer to
-   ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for more details.
- - gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
- - #gpio-cells: Should be 2. The first cell is the GPIO number and the second
-    cell specifies GPIO flags, as defined in <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>. Only the
-    GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH and GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flags are supported.
- - gpio-ranges: Range of pins managed by the GPIO controller. Refer to
-   ../gpio/gpio.txt for more details.
-
-
-Example:
---------
-
-pinctrl: pin-controller@10010000 {
-	compatible = "ingenic,jz4740-pinctrl";
-	reg = <0x10010000 0x400>;
-	#address-cells = <1>;
-	#size-cells = <0>;
-
-	gpa: gpio@0 {
-		compatible = "ingenic,jz4740-gpio";
-		reg = <0>;

-		gpio-controller;
-		gpio-ranges = <&pinctrl 0 0 32>;
-		#gpio-cells = <2>;
-
-		interrupt-controller;
-		#interrupt-cells = <2>;

-		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
