Yeah, libgpiod has similar problems to the v1 uAPI - there is no
easy way to extend it without causing breakage.

I've got a patch that ports libgpiod to the v2 uAPI, though it only goes
as far as v1 parity.  That is passing all existing tests.  The patch
doesn't address debounce as that will require libgpiod API changes.  Nor
does it make use of the bulk event capability, as that would change
behaviour and break some of the tests - the wait_multiple test was the
sticking point there.  Those are probably best combined with the v2.0.0
changes you are planning.

I've also got a couple of patches for minor things that I noticed while I
was in there.  I'll post them shortly.

Cheers,
Kent.
