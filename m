thanks for this very detail prototype! it works mostly, with one problem:

how to map gpio correctly to the pin from pinctrl subsystem?

for example, I specify gpio-ranges in dts, then 
                gpio0: gpio@d4019000 {
                        compatible = "spacemit,k1-gpio";
                        reg = <0x0 0xd4019000 0x0 0x100>;
			...
                        gpio-ranges = <&pinctrl 0 0 96>;
                };

		foo-gpios = <&gpio0 2 28 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

It should get GPIO_92 ( 92 = 2 * 32 + 28), but turns out GPIO_28

Probably there is something I missed...

Sounds I should implement something like irq_domain_xlate_threecell()?

I like this direction, but how we should proceed?

Let's try first, sounds it's a feasible way.
