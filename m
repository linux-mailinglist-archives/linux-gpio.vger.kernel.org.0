Yes, I know, I pointed out on his series that the protocol has still to
be fixed to be aligned with the latest BETA2 spec (we changed the spec
on the fly while he was already posting indeed..)

Yes, but you are basically using some exported symbol to parse the DT in
your way and then you do not use anything of the various
functions/groups stuff...you just leverage some of the probing stuff and
then issue you OEM Type configs....I mean most of the picntrl-scmi
driver would be unused anyway in this scenario.

Ok here I lost you.

The protocol ID 0x19 is bound to the protocol layer and identifies the
standard Pinctrl protocol: usually you use a 0x99 to define and describe
you own specific NEW vendor protocol, BUT here you are saying you are fine to
use std Pinctrl spec AND the protocol operations as exposed in pinctrl.c, so
I dont see why you should use a new vendor protocol_id to basically
expose the same operations. (and I also dont see how you can do that
without hacks in the current codebase)

You CAN have multiple SCMI drivers using the same protocol at the same
time (even more than one protocol at the same time), even though we try
to avoid it if there are no good reason to have more than one driver, there
is nothing in the spec or in the current SCMI platform or agent stacks that
inhibits such scenario (and I use iot heavily for my offline testing
indeed.)

Look at:

 - drivers/hwmon/scmi-hwmon 
 - drivers/iio/common/scmi_sensors/scmi_iio.c

and you'll see that these 2 drivers uses the same SENSOR protocol, just for
different sensor types so they do not interfere one with each other.

What happens is that the first driver using a protocol causes its
protocol_init to be called once for all.

This should work flawlessly like this, if this is not the case for some
reason, this will have to be fixed in the protocol implementation: you
are supposed to be able to grab the same protocol from different
drivers without any issue.

I agree that you have to be careful not to share the same pins across 2
different drivers using the same Pinctrl driver, but even if both driver
are compiled in, nothing is really happening until the related DT
binding are parsed, and so unless you mismatch your DT and assign same
pins to both the Generic SCMI Pinctrl and to the IMX SCMI Pinctrl I dont
see how they can interfere. You could indeed, have a set of pins managed
by your custom IMX driver and one distinct other set of pins handled by
the SCMI Generic driver by Oleksii, both magically handled by the same
SCMI Server backend :P !

BUT to be on the safe side you could anyway force a conflict in Kconfig
to mutually exclude one driver when the other is built and vice-versa.

Am I missing something ? Why would you need a new vendor ID to define a
new protocol without not really having any new protocol ?

Thanks,
Cristian
