Yes, this is what I meant: if fwnodes can be created before struct
device (as it is now) and their life-time is separated then how could
you possibly make the fwnode part of struct device?

No it doesn't. We have the software node - the template for the
device. It can only be populated with a single device entry. Once it's
done, I don't see why you wouldn't want to assign this device to its
corresponding software node. Provided locking is in place etc.

I will do it but I'd like to clarify the above at some point.
