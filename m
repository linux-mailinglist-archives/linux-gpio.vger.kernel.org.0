It's actually that gpio_to_irq() is solely for GPIOs which initially are not IRQs.

But it's not wrong. Some cases simply make little or no sense, but in principal
why not? Yes, it may be fragile or too much customized.

GpioInt() is orthogonal to GPIO APIs in Linux kernel. It close to be
impossible. Also see above.

No problem, you're welcome, it's good that you started a discussion!
