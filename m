I see.

However my support is not designed for a general purpose board where GPIOs usage
may vary, but for final products where GPIO lines are well-defined (even if the
patch can be easily modified in order to support unregister() operations).

As already stated in my last e-mail to Linus GPIO aggregator doesn't allow board
manufacturer to define meaningful GPIO lines within the device tree without
additional patches or by forcing users to define them by additional commands
after boot.

Why a LED should be easily and completely managed within the device-tree and a
rel√®, a photo-diode or any other input/output digital line should not? :-/

The driver by Pantelis Antoniou and my support does this jobs without interfere
with other GPIOs mechanisms.

I think the maintainers should seriously consider it.

Ciao,

Rodolfo
