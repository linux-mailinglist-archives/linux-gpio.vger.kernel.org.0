This patch is not really an API, but extension to the current one so
that clients does not need to be aware of the shared use.

would it be better to have
include/linux/gpio/consumer-refcounted.h

Would you scan all pins for each gpio-chip during boot time or scan only
when a gpio is requested and it is not already requested (so it is shared)?

As I said before, I think this refcounting is not going to work nicely
when we have actually shared gpio.

OK.

So. If we give this to multiple users then how different GPIO_ACTIVE_*
would be handled? What flag would be used for gd?
How do we know which level that needs to be preserved?

struct gpio_refcount_desc *gpiod_refcounted_get(struct device *dev,
					const char *con_id,
					enum gpiod_flags flags,
					bool i_care_for_asserted_state);

Would take care of that, but we will still have the issue coming from
the global refcounting.

Hrm, actually we might not. If we use the level_refcount to count for
high for example, then we would never decrement below 0 (as I do in this
patch) then things might be balanced.
No, they are not:

We want high refcount for the gpio.
Driver1 probes, asks for gpio and it asks it to be low.
Driver1 sets the gpio to high as it is enabled.
Driver2 probes, asks for the gpio and it asks it to be low.
Device1 also got reset.
Driver2 is not enabling the gpio as it is not needing it
Driver1 bugs out on access to chip.

One thing which might work, but it might be a longer shot:
If there is a chance that the driver is used in shared gpio case, the
driver needs to use the new API. I would not call it refcounted, but
perhaps 'managed'?

When the first driver requests the gpio, then we would allocate a
'master' managed descriptor, similar to "struct gpio_refcount_desc" but
with list_head and probably something else as well (lock/mutex, whatever
we need). Get the gpio for it, mark it as shared.
Allocate a 'client' managed struct which we add to the list and give it
back to the driver requesting the gpio line.

Likely the 'master' struct needs to be in a global list as well to be
able to find the correct one when someone else is requesting the same
gpio, which is already managed.
SO we might need to list_heads in there, one for the global 'masters'
list and one for it's 'clients' list.

From here it is kind of simple as when a client driver asks for a level,
we will change the 'client' node's state the the level and then ask the
'master' to check all of it's 'clients' current state and decide if the
real GPIO needs to be changed and to what level.
