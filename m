No it may still enter deeper state next time.

We do lazily disable IRQ.Â  but didnot understand why lazily disable when 
they are being handled?

The edge type irqs gets masked immediatly if one irq is being handled 
and another comes in.

but that's not a problem.

yes, IRQs should be enabled in both PDC and GIC before platform (PSCI 
suspend) happens if they are marked for wakeup (enable_irq_wake())

i didn't get this point.

During idle, if the driver choosen to keep IRQ enabled, it should be 
enabled in both PDC and GIC

if the driver choosen to keep IRQ disabled, with this series...

a. do a lay disable when driver's call disable_irq(), meaning set the SW 
state as disabled but leave in PDC and GIC HW as unmasked/enabled.

b. if the IRQ comes inbetween and its of edge type, the generic 
handle_edge_irq will really mask in HW.

Correct, During this time (non-idle, non-suspend) PDC will be in 
something called "by pass mode" where it plays role of type conversion.

(a level low to level high / edge falling to edge rising) since GIC 
doesn't detect level low/falling edge IRQs.
