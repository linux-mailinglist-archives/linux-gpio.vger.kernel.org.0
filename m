Sure, feel free to extend the driver.

Two LCDC instances -> two lcd-controller@... nodes. It's that simple.

The other features you listed are outside the LCDC, so outside the=20

How did you read them?
Do it from the regmap: should be "cat=20
/sys/kernel/debug/regmap/13050000.lcd-controller/registers" (not sure=20
about the path)

It won't be called until the HDMI driver says that the cable is=20
plugged, and there's a client application (e.g. fbdev emulation)=20
running. So the problem is most likely within the HDMI driver.
