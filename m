Hi Mukesh,

For IPQ chipsets, for the crashdump to work, we need the below patch

firmware: scm: Modify only the download bits in TCSR register

can you post the below patches separately? Looks like minidump will take 
some time and also I don't see any dependencies for these to go along 
with the minidump. Given that, will it be possible to post the below 
patches separately?

   firmware: qcom_scm: provide a read-modify-write function
   pinctrl: qcom: Use qcom_scm_io_update_field()
   firmware: scm: Modify only the download bits in TCSR register

Do let us know if we can take these patches and post it separately.

Thanks,

Kathiravan T.
