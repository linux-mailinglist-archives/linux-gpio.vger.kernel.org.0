I don't think "on" is a particularly descriptive or useful property name 
for something that has no "off" state. Furthermore it's no help at all 
if the DT consumer *is* the bootloader that's expected to configure this 
in the first place. IMO it would seem a lot more sensible to have an 
integer (or enum) property which describes the actual value for the 
initial I/O domain setting. Then Linux can choose to assume the presence 
of the property at all implies that the bootloader should have set it up 
already, but also has the option of actively enforcing it as well if we 
want to.

This is describing a Linux implementation detail, not the binding 
itself. There's no technical reason a DT consumer couldn't already 
figure this much out from the existing topology (by observing that the 
pinctrl consumer is a grandparent of the I/O domain's supply).

Thanks,
Robin.
