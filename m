We don't really have any specific commit which introduces this issue so
I did not add fixes tag here.

Yes, thanks for pointing it out. This flag introduced should be a member of
gpio_chip structure as mentioned by Gabriel and then it should work for
multiple gpio chips as well.

No, the above code will still bring in issues when gc->to_irq is NULL
and will return -ENXIO. We have seen race in registering of gc->to_irq
as well which is why we had introduced the following patch as the first 
step.
