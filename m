I was checking hwtracing[1] and pmu interface introduction of
address filtering[3] from analogy point of view, which i think you
meant that perf framework was extended to accommodate this.

Minidump is quite different and simple in its way to address the problem
of debugging on end user devices with minimum data captured to debug 
crashes and this patch series is inline with similar (core + backend)
implementation done for stm patches[1] where stm core was developed
and intel trace hub get hooked into it and later it got reused in [2] by 
coresight-stm driver.

I am still exploring if something available we can reuse but it seems 
unlikely at the moment to already available something in the kernel with
similar use case.
