Most of the Qualcomm SoCs does not support *warm boot* and that is the
base requirement for pstore(ram) to work to preserve the content of
fixed region during the reboot. So, it will not work those SOCs.

Minidump in its capability can do more than what is available
through pstore, it can dump ramoops region as one of data point
for debugging but it can dump anything given the size and address.

We can make minidump it another backend of pstore(ram), and improve
pstore with more debug data collection during panic like timer data or 
irqstats etc. which was our final goal with minidump that way pstore
also gets benefit and minidump will just collect what is there in
pstore(ram). but for that we need base infrastructure driver to
merge.

One of the proposal made here..
