Looking into DSDT I think the problem is much worse. First of all there are
many cases where pins like 0x140, 0x1c0, etc are being used. On top of that
there is no GPIO driver in the upstream (as far as I can see by HID, perhaps
there is a driver but for different HID. And I see that GPIO device consumes a
lot of Interrupts from GIC as well (it's ARM platfrom as far as I understand).

Looking at the Microsoft brain damaged way of understanding GPIOs and hardware
[1], I am afraid you really want to have a specific GPIO driver for this. So,
for now until we have better picture of what's going on, NAK to this patch.

[1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/general-purpose-i-o--gpio-

  "...All banks have the same number of pins, except for the last bank, which
   might have fewer."

They added completely unnecessary mapping layer and brought a lot of confusion
to everybody (developers, users, etc).
