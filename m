Hence "unlikely" in my mail :)

This is all nice information, but not really relevant here - this is a
binding patch, not a driver one & the conversation stemmed from me
making sure that a fallback compatible was not suitable. Whether or not
there are multiple drivers or not is someone else's problem!
