Hum, I am a bit lost.
Some DT example (base and overlay) could help me to understand.

Support for PWM has been recently accepted.
  https://lore.kernel.org/all/ufl4kwrjyp4zid4muvghefevqc6hk3zyvxnsu72fxd4f46fzg6@hufkci2dzjid/

For i2c, nexus node is not suitable.

Nexus node works well when resources are indexed (gpio line in a gpio chip
for instance). For bus controller there is no index.
I mean we never refer a i2c bus controller using <&i2c-ctrl 12>.

For i2c, I proposed i2c bus extension:
  https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250205173918.600037-1-herve.codina@bootlin.com/
