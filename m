Firstly, sorry if I gave the impression I'm all in on this idea - this
is still spitballing.

You are extending the analogy too far, I'm only applying it to names and how
name instability might be viewed from the user's perspective.
I was thinking it could be a deal-breaker, but if it is ok for the
filesystem then maybe not.

I have no problem considering the line name to be metadata, not data (line
configuration and value).

You aren't allowing all users - you are allowing those that have
permission to open the chip, so it can be locked down if necessary, the same
as requesting the line.

Having said all that, I am uneasy that this capability could be abused,
particularly in ways we can't anticipate.
So I'm at the point that I think we could do it, one way or another, but
much less certain if we should.
I would not consider it if there was an alternative.

Cheers,
Kent.
