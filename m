In general I'm fine with this, but looking to the history of your changes I'm
afraid that in future it will require more than one pin to be listed or
something like this.

Perhaps we may take list of pins or a bitmap (see bitmap list parsers API).

...

Isn't it now a part of ABI? I don't think we may remove it, though we may ignore it.
Or do something else.

(One of the reasons why I hate module parameters)

It's casted to signed because ..?
