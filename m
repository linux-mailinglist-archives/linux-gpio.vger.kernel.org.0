This is indeed an interesting issue. Thx for the comment, Linus.
**Let me explain how: "p->state becomes volatile in the list iterator", 
and "why READ_ONCE is suggested".

The current critical code is:
   list_for_each_entry(setting, &p->state->settings, node)

after elaborating the define list_for_each_entry, so above critical code 
will be:
   for (setting = list_head(&p->state->settings, typeof(*setting), node); \
&setting->node != (&p->state->settings); \
setting = list_next(setting , node))

The asm code(refer result from Clang version 10.0) can cleared explain 
the step of p->state reload actions:
loop:
ldr x22,[x22] ; x22=list_next(setting , node))
add x9,x8,#0x18 ; x9=&p->state->setting
cmp x22,x9 ; setting,x9
b.eq 0xFFFFFF9B24483530

ldr w9,[x22,#0x10] ; w9,[setting,#16]
cmp w9,#0x2 ; w9,#2
b.ne 0xFFFFFF9B24483504

mov x0,x22 ; x0,setting
bl 0xFFFFFF9B24486048 ; pinmux_disable_setting

ldr x8,[x19,#0x28] ; x19=p, x8=[p->state], *reload p->state*
b loop

The *reload p->state* inside the loop for checking is not needed and can 
cause possible infinite loop. So READ_ONCE is highly suggested even if 
p->state is not randomly changed. And then unnecessary "ldr 
x8,[x19,#0x28]" can be removed from above loop code.

**Comments about the locking bug:
currently pinctrl_select_state is an export symbol and don't have 
effective reentrance protect design. That's why current infinite loop 
issue was observed with customer's multi thread call with 
pinctrl_select_state without lock protection. pinctrl_select_state 
totally rely on driver module user side to ensure the reentrant state.

Usually the suggested usage from driver side who are using pinctrl would be:
LOCK;
pinctrl_select_state();
gpio pulling;
udelay();
check state;
other hardware behaviors;
UNLOCK;

So the locking bug fix I have told customer side to fix from their own 
driver part. Since usually not only a simple pinctrl_select_state call 
can finish the hardware state transaction.

I myself also is fine to have a small per pinctrl lock to only protect 
the current pinctrl_select_state->pinctrl_commit_state reentrance 
issues. Pls any pinctrl maintainer help to comment to suggest or not and 
I can prepare a change as well.

Sure, I am trying to explain from my end. If there is other thoughts pls 
feel free to chime in.
