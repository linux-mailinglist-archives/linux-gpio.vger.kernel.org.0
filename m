I see and I understand.

The problem is that for camera sensors Intel uses this special
INT3472 ACPI device with a custom _DSM to list GPIOs, with the _DSM
returning an u32 and one of the bits in the u32 is the polarity.

We really do not want to deal with this Intel camera team hack
inside gpiolib-acpi and I can understand why you and Linus W
want to get rid of functions which allow drivers to meddle
with a gpio_desc's active-low flag.

So using a temporary gpio-lookup in the int3472 code as
you are proposing is the best (least bad) thing to do
here then.

I'll try to make some time to test this sometime
the coming days.

Other then the discussion we just had is there any specific
reason why this should be considered a RFC / why this would
not be ready for merging?  (I still need to review these,
but lets assume that goes well)

Regards,

Hans
