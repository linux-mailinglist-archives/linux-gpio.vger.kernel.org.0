Commit aa23ca3d98f7 ("gpiolib: acpi: Add honor_wakeup module-option +
quirk mechanism") added a quirk for some models of the HP x2 10 series.

There are 2 issues with the comment describing the quirk:
1) The comment claims the DMI quirk applies to all Cherry Trail based HP =
x2
   10 models. In the mean time I have learned that there are at least 3
   variants of the HP x2 10 models:

   Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
   Cherry Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
   Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC

   And this quirk's DMI matches only match the Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC
   SoC, which is good because we want a slightly different quirk for the
   others. This commit updates the comment to make it clear that the quir=
k
   is only for the Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC variants.

2) The comment says that it is ok to disable wakeup on all ACPI GPIO even=
t
   handlers, because there is only the one for the embedded-controller
   events. This is not true, there also is a handler for the special
   INT0002 device which is related to USB wakeups. We need to also disabl=
e
   wakeups on that one because the device turns of the USB-keyboard built
   into the dock when closing the lid. The XHCI controller takes a while
   to notice this, so it only notices it when already suspended, causing
   a spurious wakeup because of this. So disabling wakeup on all handlers
   is the right thing to do, but not because there only is the one handle=
r
   for the EC events. This commit updates the comment to correctly reflec=
t
   this.

rk mechanism")
