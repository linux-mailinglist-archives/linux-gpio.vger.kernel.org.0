I find this approach quite nice. io-domains in their core specify pin
voltages, so having the tie in the pinctrl space makes a lot of sense.

though you could also add the main props to the dtsi and use a per-board
/delete-property/ to free up the pmic-i2c, same result but less duplicate
dt additions and less clutter.

just move it to use dev_dbg and everybody is happy :-) .

I think this should work even with io-domain "disabled" or as module
when slightly modified.

I.e. for disabled nodes, no kernel-device should be created
(grp->io_domain will be NULL) and for a module the device itself is created
when the dt is parsed (of_populate...) and will just not have probed yet.

Together with the comment farther above of having the io-domain link always
present we should get rid of the error condition though :-) .



Hmm, while going through this one thought was, do we want more verbosity
in the dt for this?

I.e. with the current approach we'll have

&io_domains {
	status = "okay";

	audio-supply = <&pp1800_audio>;
	bt656-supply = <&pp1800_ap_io>;
	gpio1830-supply = <&pp3000_ap>;
	sdmmc-supply = <&ppvar_sd_card_io>;
};

and pinctrl entries linking to the core <&io_domains> node. This might bite
us down the road again in some form.

Something like doing an optional updated binding like:

&io_domains {
	status = "okay";

	audio-domain {
		domain-supply = <&pp1800_audio>;
	};
	bt656-domain {
		domain-supply = <&pp1800_ap_io>;
	};
	gpio1830-domain {
		domain-supply = <&pp3000_ap>;
	};
	sdmmc-domain {
		domain-supply = <&ppvar_sd_card_io>;
	};
};

       pcie {
               pcie_ep_gpio: pci-ep-gpio {
                       rockchip,pins =
                               <4 RK_PC6 RK_FUNC_GPIO &pcfg_pull_none>;
                       rockchip,io-domains = <&gpio1830_domain>;
               };
       };


I.e. linking the pin-set to a definition of its actual io-domain, instead
of only the general io-domain node. Somewhat similar to power-domains.

The code itself could be the same as now (except needing to get the parent
of the linked node for the io-domains), but would leave us the option of
modifying code behaviour without touching the binding if needed down the
road.
