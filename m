I added error checking wherever gpiod_get_value() is called to see what
happens, and I'm sending a v2 series with this change. The code got
longer, but I've kept it still pretty readable. It still feels like a
half solution as gpiod_set_value() is void and thus no error checking
can be done on it, but let's see yours and other's opinion.
