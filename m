Hi All,

The first patch just updates the comment describing why we are ignoring
GPIO ACPI event wakeups on HP x2 10 models.

The second patch is more interesting, in the mean time I've learned their
are actually at least 3 variants of the HP x2 10, and the original quirk
only applies to the Cherry Trail with TI PMIC variant (and the original
DMI match only matches that model). We need a similar quirk for the
Bay Trail with AXP288 model, but there we only want to ignore the wakeups
for the GPIO ACPI event which is (ab)used for embedded-controller events
on this model while still honoring the wakeup flags on other pins.

I'm not 100% happy with the solution I've come up with to allow ignoring
events on a single pin. But this was the best KISS thing I could come up
with. Alternatives would involve string parsing (*), which I would rather
avoid. I'm very much open to alternatives for the current approach in the
second patch.

Since sending out the first 2 patches of this series I've received
positive testing feedback for the quirk for the HP X2 10 Cherry Trail +
AXP288 PMIC variant, so here is a resend of the first 2 patches with
a third patch adding a quirk for the third variant of HP X2 10 added.

Regards,

Hans


*) And more complex DMI quirk handling since now we would need to store
a string + some other flags in the DMI driver_data
