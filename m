>    using "Input-value" configuration type. (See the spec[4], table-23.)

> 2) DT bindings

> 3) generic GPIO driver
>    Based on (2), I tried to prototype a generic driver in patch#4.

Any comment here: I'm listed as a designated reviewer of GPIO patches, why am I
not Cc'ed on this? I definitely have some comments against the code (no DT,
though). Please, use (up-to-date) MAINTAINERS in your v3.
