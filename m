Thanks for testing!

As Yury mentioned we need to look at bitmap APIs and make them possible to have
a compile-time optimizations. With that in mind, I would prefer bitmap APIs
over open-coded stuff which is hardly to be understood (yes, I still point
out that it takes a few hours to me, maybe because I'm stupid enough, to
get what's the heck is going one there, esp. for the == 1 case).

Yet, it opens a way to scale this in case we might have v3 ABI that let's say
allows to work with 512 GPIOs at a time. With your code it will be much harder
to achieve and see what you wrote about maintenance (in that case).
