Yes, but as far as I understand we have already this firmware in the
wild, so we will have users stuck with it...

Can you be absolutely sure? If you have banks (MS core code since the
laptop runs Windows uses what is described on their site for GPIOs)
linear and then you test pins at the beginning of the region, you
won't have issues, you need to find a pin in each tile wishfully at
the end of it and test.

Better and easier way of course to ask MS to provide an insight on this.

Okay, since we have no solid proof of what's going on there, I prefer
for now not to touch GPIO ACPI core and do this quirk in the driver
(using standard methods: DMI strings / ACPI IDs / etc).

Otherwise I'm not convinced that we need a global quirk for that and
it might be needed in the future.
