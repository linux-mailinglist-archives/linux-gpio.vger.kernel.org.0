I know - but your criteria was reuse... ;-).

OK, USED it shall be.

Ok, and I've changed the values field name to bitmap, along with the change
to a bitmap type, so the stuttering is gone.

And, as the change to bitmap substantially reduced the size of
gpioline_config, I now embed that in the gpioline_info instead of
duplicating all the other fields.  The values field will be zeroed
when returned within info.

To me "default" implies a fallback value, and that de-emphasises the
fact that the lines will be immediately set to those values as they
are switched to outputs.
These are the values the outputs will take - the "default" doesn't add
anything.

OK.  I was only thinking about the edge events, but you might want it
for your line info events on the chip fd as well?

Yeah, it would only be relevant if edge detection was set and, as per
edge detection itself, would only be settable via the request, not
via set_config.  It would only be a suggestion, as the kfifo size gets
rounded up to a power of 2 anyway.  It would be capped - I'm open to
suggestions for a suitable max value.  And the 0 value would mean use
the default - currently 16 per line.

If you want the equivalent for the info watch then I'm not sure where to
hook it in.  It should be at the chip scope, and there isn't any
suitable ioctl to hook it into so it would need a new one - maybe a
set_config for the chip?  But the buffer size would only be settable up
until you add a watch.

Cheers,
Kent.
