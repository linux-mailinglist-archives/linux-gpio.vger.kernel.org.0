Sorry, but the era of static configuration where one has a well defined
order in which things are probed and numbered has long gone. The right
answer is either device aliases that provides stable numbering on a
board that is not dependent on scheduler behavior, mutexes
implementation (how they deal with writer starvation, etc),
kernel/driver/subsystem linking order and myriad other things, or
mounting by UUID. The kernel does not provide any guarantees on the
stability of device probe and instantiation order.

If you think about it it is the same issue as legacy GPIO numbering.
It was convenient some time ago, but now it is no longer suitable or
sufficient and could change when kernel is uprevved.

Yes, I guess there is a contention on this mutex and the fact that we
are now taking it once and not twice makes difference in which probes
happen. If you look at the logs, you will see that even before the patch
controllers did not enumerate on the order of PCI functions:

[   36.439057] mmc0: SDHCI controller on PCI [0000:00:01.0] using ADMA
[   36.450924] mmc2: SDHCI controller on PCI [0000:00:01.3] using ADMA
[   36.459355] mmc1: SDHCI controller on PCI [0000:00:01.2] using ADMA

So you have mmc2 instantiated before mmc1 even before the patch. This
happens because we now have

		.probe_type = PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS,

in sdhci_driver structure in drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-pci-core.c. It just
happened that even with asynchronous probing your storage did end up on
mmc0 originally and you were happy.

I wonder, could you please post entire dmesg for your system?

Rob might not want them, but they are the reality and are present for
multiple classes of devices and I believe are here to stay.

I think the right answer is "fix the userspace" really in this case. We
could also try extend of_alias_get_id() to see if we could pass some
preferred numbering on x86. But this will again be fragile if the
knowledge resides in the driver and is not tied to a particular board
(as it is in DT case): there could be multiple controllers, things will
be shifting board to board...

Thanks.
