Maybe I was not so clear, but as Bart mentioned the least you can do
is simply define line name via "gpio-line-names" property. The problem
here is when and how you would like to have them incorporated.
When: if ACPI tables are being provided by firmware which you may not
alter, then you must use initramfs type of solution (no configfs,
don't know about EFI var though). How: In that case you might have a
chance to incorporate _DSD() method into *existing* _CRS() one.
Possible impediments: if ACPI table from firmware already has a _DSD()
defined or above is not working for some reason. In such a case you
must upgrade entire DSDT via initramfs.
