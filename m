(i.eÂ  Some pins in hardware be configured as active low, this can vary between hardware samples. User application uses gpio-line-name property to map pins and port, this helps the application to handle pin change from hardware sample to sample. As of now there is no configuration available for user space applications for polarity.)

This is pretty useful to be able to abstract polarity (and other properties from userspace).

I was thinking of adding a virtual gpio provider for one pin that just uses the dt consumer bindings to hide
polarities etc from userspace.

Or use the gpio led driver (or similar)
