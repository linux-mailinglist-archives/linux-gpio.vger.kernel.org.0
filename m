Hi Rob,
I initially submitted a patch to revert the kernel to original
behavior, but it created more problems because the patch was
unfortunately split in two separate patches, and mixed with other non
closely-related changes. It was also noted to me that reverting to the
old behavior would break things for some users.

It was suggested to me by a more experienced kernel developer to
"suggest a fix, instead of hurrying a revert":

    https://lkml.org/lkml/2023/5/17/758

That is what we decided to do in the end, and it worked quite well.

Hugo.
