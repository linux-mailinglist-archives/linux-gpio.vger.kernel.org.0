Sorry, just joining the thread now.  Hopefully I'm addressing everything 
targeted at me.

I used to do kernel work on MSMs, then kernel work on server CPUs, but 
now I do kernel work on AI accelerators.  Never was on the firmware 
team, but I have a lot of contacts in those areas.  On my own time, I 
support Linux on the Qualcomm laptops.

Its not MS that needs to fix things (although there is plenty of things 
I could point to that MS could fix), its the Qualcomm Windows FW folks. 
  They have told me a while ago they were planning on fixing this issue 
on some future chipset, but apparently that hasn't happened yet.  Sadly, 
once these laptops ship, they are in a frozen maintenance mode.

In my opinion, MS has allowed Qualcomm to get away with doing bad things 
in ACPI on the Qualcomm laptops.  The ACPI is not a true hardware 
description that is OS agnostic as it should be, and probably violates 
the spec in many ways.  Instead, the ACPI is written against the Windows 
drivers, and has a lot of OS driver crap pushed into it.

The GPIO description is one such thing.

As I understand it, any particular SoC will have a number of GPIOs 
supported by the TLMM.  0 - N.  Linux understands this.  However, in the 
ACPI of the Qualcomm Windows laptops, you will likely find atleast one 
GPIO number which exceeds this N.  These are "virtual" GPIOs, and are a 
construct of the Windows Qualcomm TLMM driver and how it interfaces with 
the frameworks within Windows.

Some GPIO lines can be configured as wakeup sources by routing them to a 
specific hardware block in the SoC (which block it is varies from SoC to 
SoC).  Windows has a specific weird way of handling this which requires 
a unique "GPIO chip" to handle.  GPIO chips in Windows contain 32 GPIOs, 
so for each wakeup GPIO, the TLMM driver creates a GPIO chip 
(essentially creating 32 GPIOs), and assigns the added GPIOs numbers 
which exceed N.  The TLMM driver has an internal mapping of which 
virtual GPIO number corresponds to which real GPIO.

So, ACPI says that some peripheral has GPIO N+X, which is not a real 
GPIO.  That peripheral goes and requests that GPIO, which gets routed to 
the TLMM driver, and the TLMM driver translates that number to the real 
GPIO, and provides the reference back to the peripheral, while also 
setting up the special wakeup hardware.

So, N+1 is the first supported wakup GPIO, N+1+32 is the next one, then 
N+1+32+32, and so on.

I see how this creates a nice mess for running Linux on these laptops, 
but I don't have a good idea how to work around it.  Per SoC, you'd need 
to know the mapping and translate it for ACPI when running the Windows 
version of the FW (yes most Qualcomm MSMs have OS specific firmware), 
but reject such gpio numbers when running other firmware, or I guess on 
different targets.
