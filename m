I understand your point, but I disagree with the omni appliance of 3.

No, the release is special as it's used in error paths and there often
it is simpler for all just to ignore invalid pointers rather then put
a burden on the driver developers. The gpiod_set_*() and gpiod_get_*() over
_assumed requested_ descriptor of course should fail any attempt to be supplied
with an invalid pointer.

This is again unrelated. devres is an upper layer and we don't care about its
implementation which is logically correct since we assume to put on the list
only _valid_ resources.

It's up to the driver developer.

Again, if you want the result of gpiod_get() to be tested, mark it so.
That's why I think your initial point is mistargetting.

Ask yourself, why we don't fail kfree() on a NULL object? (from kfree() p.o.v.
it's an invalid one) Or if you want to be more precise in analogue with the
gpiod_get_optional(), consider

	p = kmalloc(0);
	kfree(p);

and this is valid code despite p being not NULL!
