This patch series adds basic pinctrl support for StarFive JH7110 SoC.

Changes since v4:
Patch 1 & 2:
- Added pinmux-node.yaml reference for '-pins$' patternProperties.
- Dropped reference for pinmux properties.

  v4: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230203141801.59083-1-hal.feng@starfivetech.com/

Changes since v3:
- Rebased on Linus's "devel" branch of linux-pinctrl repo, which was based on
  on tag v6.2-rc1.
- Dropped patch 1.
Patch 2 & 3:
- Added a reference for '-pins$' patternProperties.
- Put "additionalProperties: false" before properties section. (by Rob)
- Improved the description.
- Changed the node name in examples from "gpio" to "pinctrl".
Patch 4:
- Added some missing headers. (by Andreas)

  v3: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20221220005529.34744-1-hal.feng@starfivetech.com/

Changes since v2:
- Rebased on tag v6.1.
Patch 1:
- Renamed pinctrl-starfive-jh7110.h to
  starfive,jh7110-pinctrl.h. (by Krzysztof)
- Separated the register values in the binding header and stored them in
  a new file arch/riscv/boot/dts/starfive/jh7110-pinfunc.h. (by Krzysztof)
- Split patch 1 into sys part and aon part. Merged them into patch 2
  and patch 3 respectively.
Patch 2 & 3:
- Dropped "reg-names" and the description of "interrupts". Dropped quotes
  behind "$ref" and kept consisitent quotes. (by Krzysztof)
- Moved gpio properties behind interrupt properties.
- Moved "required" behind "patternProperties". (by Krzysztof)
- Rewrote the examples of bindings. (by Krzysztof and Emil)
- Added Co-developed-by tag for Emil.
- Dropped unused "clocks" property in patch 3.
Patch 4 & 5:
- Renamed "pinctrl-starfive.*" to "pinctrl-starfive-jh7110.*" and replaced
  all "starfive_" prefix with "jh7110_" in these files. (by Emil)
- Dropped macro GPIO_NUM_PER_WORD. (by Emil)
- Dropped unused flag member in starfive_pinctrl_soc_info structure. (by Emil)
- Renamed "pinctrl-jh7110-sys.c" to "pinctrl-starfive-jh7110-sys.c".
  Renamed "pinctrl-jh7110-aon.c" to "pinctrl-starfive-jh7110-aon.c". (by Emil)
- Added individual Kconfig options for sys and aon pinctrl drivers. (by Emil)
- Made the sys and aon pinctrl drivers be modules. (by Emil)
- Added "JH7110_" prefix for macro SYS_GPO_PDA_0_74_CFG,
  SYS_GPO_PDA_89_94_CFG and AON_GPO_PDA_0_5_CFG. (by Emil)
- Dropped jh7110_sys_pinctrl_probe() and jh7110_aon_pinctrl_probe().
  Got the match data in the common jh7110_pinctrl_probe() and used it
  to probe. (by Emil)
- Dropped the of_match_ptr macro(). (by Emil)
- Set the MODULE_LICENSE as "GPL" according to commit bf7fbeeae6db.

  v2: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20221118011108.70715-1-hal.feng@starfivetech.com/

Changes since v1:
- Rebased on tag v6.1-rc5.
- Dropped patch 22 and 23 since they were merged in v6.1-rc1.
- Removed some unused macros and register values which do not belong to
  bindings. Simplified pinctrl definitions in patch 24. (by Krzysztof)
- Split the bindings into sys pinctrl bindings and aon pinctrl bindings,
  and split patch 25 into two patches.
- Made the bindings follow generic pinctrl bindings. (by Krzysztof)
- Fixed some wrong indentation in bindings, and checked it with
  `make dt_binding_check`.
- Split the patch 26 into two patches which added sys and aon pinctrl
  driver respectively.
- Restructured the pinctrl drivers so made them follow generic pinctrl
  bindings. Rewrote `dt_node_to_map` and extracted the public code to make
  it clearer.

  v1: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220929143225.17907-1-hal.feng@linux.starfivetech.com/
