If you have a URL for those datasheets, can you share it?  I spent
some time looking but all I found was 1-2 page marketing brochures.

Should Vaibhav re-post this patch, or do you want to pull it from the
archives?  I just checked and it still applies cleanly to v5.14-rc1.

Here it is for reference:
  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200402155057.30667-1-vaibhavgupta40@gmail.com/

I'll post a couple small patches toward unifying them.  They don't do
the whole job but they're baby steps.
