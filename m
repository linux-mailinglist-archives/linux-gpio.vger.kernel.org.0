Hello My friend,

I offer my friendship and believe you will accept me with good heart,
I was pushed to contact you and see how best we can assist each other.
I am Mr Simon Dornoo, a Bank  manager here in Ghana Commercial Bank
(GCB. I believe it is the wish of God for me to come across you now. I
am having an important business discussion I wish to share with you
which I believe we are going to benefit from it.person but if you are
not the intended receiver, do let me know whether you can be of
assistance regarding my proposal below because it is top secret.

I am about to retire from active Bank service to start a new life but
I am sceptical to reveal this particular secret to a stranger. You
must assure me that everything will be handled confidentially because
we are not going to suffer again in life. It has been 10 years now
that most of the greedy African Politicians used our bank to launder
money overseas through the help of their Political advisers. Most of
the funds which they transferred out of the shores of Africa were gold
and oil money that was supposed to have been used to develop the
continent. Their Political advisers always inflated the amounts before
transfer to foreign accounts so I also used the opportunity to divert
part of the funds hence I am aware that there is no official trace of
how much was transferred as all the accounts used for such transfers
were being closed after transfer.

It is more than Eight years now and most of the politicians are no
longer using our bank to transfer funds overseas. The ($11.5) Million
Dollars has been laying waste but I don't want to retire from the bank
without transferring the funds to a foreign account, It is better that
we claim the money, than allowing the Bank Directors to take it, they
are rich already. I am not a greedy person, so I am suggesting we
share the funds equal, 50/50% to both parties, my share will assist me
to start my own company and use the proceed for charity which has
beenmy dream.

Let me know your mind on my proposal.Please, do treat this information
as confidential and do not respond to this on facebook for security
reason.
I have more to write you about the details once I receive your urgent
response strictly through my personal Email address
below:(simondo45@outlook.com)

Have a nice day and God bless. Anticipating your urgent response

Best Regards

Mr Simon Dornoo
