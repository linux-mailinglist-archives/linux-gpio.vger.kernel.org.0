For PCIe I admit that I don't know. I don't even know if there's any
valid (current or future) use case for having the PCIe controller have a
phandle to the SerDes. Everything else below in my reply assumes Ethernet.

It's so exceedingly unlikely that B4860 will gain support for anything
new, that it's not even worth talking about it, or even considering it
in the design of a new driver. Just forget about it.

Let's concentrate on the Layerscapes, and on the T series to the extent
that we're not going out of our way to support them with a fairly simple
design.

In the Lynx 10G block guide that I have, PCCR2 is a register that does
something completely different from Ethernet. I'm not sure if B4860 has
a Lynx 10G block and not something else.

Ok, but that's a lateral argument (or I'm not understanding the connection).

Some maintainers (Mark Brown for sure, from my personal experience) prefer
that expert-level knowledge of hardware should be hardcoded into the kernel
driver based on known stuff such as the SoC-specific compatible string.
I certainly share the same view.

With your case, I think that argument is even more pertinent, because
IIUC, the lane group protocols won't be put in the SoC .dtsi (so as to
be written only once), but in the board device trees (since the
available protocols invariably depend upon the board provisioning).
So, non-expert board device tree writers will have to know what's with
the PCCR stuff. Pretty brain-intensive.

Yeah, in theory that is probably correct, but in practice can't we hide
our head in the sand and say that the "phys" phandles have to have the
lanes in the same order as LNmGCR0[1STLANE] expects them (which is also
the "natural" order as the SoC RM describes it)? With a "for" loop
implementation in the MAC, that would work just fine 100% of the time.
Doing more intricate massaging of the "phys" in the consumer, and you're
just asking for trouble. My 2 cents.

Sure, it's the same kind of ask of a board device tree writer as "hey,
please give me a good PCCR value", but I honestly think that the head
scratching will be much less severe.

XGMII is the link between the MAC and the PCS, but the "phys" phandle to
the SerDes gives insight to the MAC driver way beyond the PCS layer.
That kinda invalidates the idea that "you don't need to worry about the
actual number of lanes". When you're a MAC driver with an XLAUI link and
you need insight into the PMA/PMD layer, you'd better not be surprised
about the fact that there are 4 lanes, at the very least?

Also, I'm thinking that if you support multi-lane (which dpaa2-mac currently
doesn't, even in LSDK), you can't avoid multiple "phys" phandles in dpaa2-mac,
and a "for" loop, eventually, anyway. That's because if your lanes have protocol
retimers on them, those are going to be modeled as generic PHYs too. And those
will not be bundled in these "groups", because they might be one chip per lane.

The retimer thing isn't theoretical, but, due to reasons independent of NXP,
we lack the ability to provide an upstream user of the "lane retimer as
generic PHY" functionality in dpaa2-mac. So it stays downstream for now.

So, if you're thinking of easing the work of the consumer side, I'm not
sure that the gains will be that high.

Otherwise, I will repeat the idea that lynx-10g and lynx-28g should be
treated in unison, because some drivers (dpaa2-mac, mtip_backplane) will
have to interface with both, and I don't really believe that major deviations
in software architecture between the 2 SerDes drivers are justifiable in
any way (multi-protocol handled differently, for example).
