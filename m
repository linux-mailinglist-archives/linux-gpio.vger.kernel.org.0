Well, that can be a reason, sure. But I still wonder if Linus would have
preferred to get 49c02f6e901c and this fix for it in the same pull.
Sure, adding this fix would have been a late addition, but when it is a
fix and mentioned in the PR that from what I can see is no problem at
all for him.

Side note: with all those CIs that "sooner" became more important I'd
say, as I frequently see multiple CI systems running into and bisecting
problems -- which humans then look into and report, which is a waste of
time.

Depends on the situation. As a general approach I'd say no, but there
definitely can be situations where that is wise.

Pretty sure Linus wants maintains to just fast-track things when needed
by sending an additional PR; he multiple times said that this is not a
problem.

But there is a way to fast track things: just ask Linus to pull a patch
from the list (e.g. in a reply to the patch while CCIng tim). He
multiple times said this is no problem for him, unless it becomes the
norm. This is documented in
Documentation/process/handling-regressions.rst /
https://docs.kernel.org/process/handling-regressions.html

Ciao, Thorsten
