Dear Friend,

I hope this message meet you well, after quite a very long time. I'm
happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds
transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from India.
Presently  I'm in India for investment projects with my own share of
the total sum. meanwhile, I didn't forget your past efforts and
attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it
failed us some how.Now contact my secretary in Lome, Togo with his
below contact,I droped a certified ATM visa card, ask him to send you
the ATM visa card of $250.000.00 which I left with him for your
compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in
this matter. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much.

So feel free and get in touch with my secretary in Lome Togo and
instruct him  where to send the ATM visa card containing amount to
you.Please do let me know immediately if you receive it so that we can
share the joy after all the sufferness at that  time together. in the
moment, I'm very busy here because of the investment projects which me
and the new partner are having at hand,finally remember that I had
forwarded instruction to my secretary on your behalf to release the
ATM visa card to you and you alone, so feel free to get in touch with
him and forward him your informations,your full names,address and
contact number for easy communication until your received the ATM visa
card. if you whish to communicate futher on this issue, you can
contact my secretery Mr: Vincent Philip through this his email address
