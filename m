With respect, I think it is unreasonable to use the fact that
gpio-ml-ioh and gpio-pch should be unified to hold up the conversion
of gpio-ml-ioh to generic power management.

I do not want to skip gpio-ml-ioh for good, because it is one of the
few remaining drivers that use the legacy PCI PM interfaces.  We are
very close to being able to remove a significant amount of ugly code
from the PCI core.

gpio-ml-ioh and gpio-pch do look quite similar, and no doubt it would
be great to unify them.  But without datasheets or hardware to test,
that's not a trivial task, and I don't think that burden should fall
on anyone who wants to make any improvements to these drivers.

Another alternative would be to remove legacy PCI PM usage
(ioh_gpio_suspend() and ioh_gpio_resume()) from gpio-ml-ioh.  That
would mean gpio-ml-ioh wouldn't support power management at all, which
isn't a good thing, but maybe it would be even more motivation to
unify it with gpio-pch (which has already been converted by
226e6b866d74 ("gpio: pch: Convert to dev_pm_ops"))?
