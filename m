Indeed it was more about the definition itself - an extra property isn't 
*needed* to break the cycle since the cycle is already fully described 
in DT, so anyone who can parse parents and phandles already has 
sufficient information to detect it and break it at any point they 
choose. However, as mentioned subsequently, breaking the cycle alone 
isn't enough to guarantee that things will actually work in general.

AFAICS what we fundamentally need to know is the initial voltage of the 
supply regulator, to be able to short-circuit requiring the I/O domain 
in order to query it from the regulator itself, and instead just 
initialise the I/O domain directly. However that would still represent a 
bunch of fiddly extra DT parsing, so for practical purposes it seems 
reasonable to then short-cut that into directly describing the initial 
setting of the I/O domain on the node itself, such that the consumer of 
the binding can easily handle it all in a self-contained manner.

Cheers,
Robin
