Kernel coding style is a little different from what C demands.
Specifically, kernel style demands { } for anything multi-line.

Specifically:

	for (;;) {
		/* a comment */
		foo();
	}

or

	for (;;) {
		foo(a, very, long,
		    arg, chain);
	}

do both warrant a pile of curlies in kernel style where C does not
demand it.

Right, per scope_guard being a for loop I added the extra space. Our
coding style does;

	if (cond) { }

	while (cond) { }

	for (;;) { }

etc.. so I too did:

	scoped_guard (name, args...) { }

For guard I read the first pair as if it were a C++ template, that is, I
pretend, it is actually written like:

	guard<name>(args..);

Both are 'odd' in numerous ways and inconsistent vs where the 'args...'
go, but alas, we're trying to wrangle this inside the constraints
imposed upon us by C and CPP our dear pre-processor.
