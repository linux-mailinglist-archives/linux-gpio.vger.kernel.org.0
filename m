No, I mentally did a fast-forward to moving this hack into the irq
flow, rather than doing before entering the flow. handle_fasteoi_irq
will take the lock, but obviously not with the current state of this
patch.

It really depends on whether the edges are semantically different, and
I'm not sure you can decide this at the interrupt controller
level. The core IRQ code doesn't give you a way to discriminate
between those, but endpoint drivers could, and could get terminally
confused if the see two rising edges without a falling edge in
between.

I don't disagree with any of that, except that being fine at the
irqchip level doesn't necessarily mean being fine at the endpoint
driver level. On the other hand, the HW looks terminally broken, so
maybe it doesn't matter as the drivers will have to be written with
this limitation in mind...

Easily fixed, see further down.

Requeuing interrupts would be fine, and we have the retrigger callback
for that. This can be used when you want to support level interrupts,
but your interrupt controller only supports edge. Something similar
could be done to deal with dual edge interrupts.

OK.

So here are my suggestions:

- Move your dual edge hack to the irq_ack callback

- On detecting a dual edge interrupt, switch to the
  handle_fasteoi_ack_irq flow, which will call the irq_ack callback

- Get rid of the now useless locking

I bet you could reuse some of the existing hacks, though I haven't
looked too hard because it is Saturday and this code really makes my
eyes bleed.

Thanks,

	M.
