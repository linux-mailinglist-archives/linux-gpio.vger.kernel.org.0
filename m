... from this thread, my understanding too was that this forbidden usage of
POSIX errors for in-kernel API was general to any subsystem...so the ask
for docs about this...

from checkpatch.pl:

# ENOTSUPP is not a standard error code and should be avoided in new patches.    
# Folks usually mean EOPNOTSUPP (also called ENOTSUP), when they type ENOTSUPP.  
# Similarly to ENOSYS warning a small number of false positives is expected.     
 
...so it seems to me that the this is NOT a false positive BUT Pinctrl/GPIO
subsystem is an exception in these regards, since this is what is explcitly
state in checkpatch comments AND there is no generalized doc on this....

....but twe can happily oblige to Pinctrl expectations by remapping to ENOTSUPP
in the pinctrl protocol layer or driver...just I won't certainly do that at the
SCMI core layer at all at this point...as Sudeep said ...especially because there
is NO generalized docs for the above ban of POSIX errors for in-Linux kernel API...

Thanks,
Cristian
