I understand what you are trying to say about layering, but there are
no lifetime violations here.

I don't think this is any harder to handle than how a device's
secondary fwnode is handled in set_primary_fwnode(). For secondary
fwnodes, you just WARN and overwrite it and move on.

Similar to how set_primary_fwnode() handles deletion (NULL), you can
handle the same for when a device is removed. You can check the parent
or the bus for another device with the same fwnode and set it.

Using fwnode_handle->dev is no different than searching a bus for a
device which has dev->fwnode match the fwnode you are looking for.

In both cases, you are just going to get the first device that was
added. It's completely pointless to force searching a bus to find the
device with a specific fwnode.

In the special cases where one fwnode has multiple devices, no generic
code is going to always handle the device search correctly. The
framework adding those devices probably knows what's the right thing
to do based on which of the N devices with the same fwnode they are
trying to find.

I understand it's not great, but blindly saying "search the bus" isn't
really improving anything here and just makes things unnecessarily
inefficient.
