I guess Shawn is referring to my rework of that quirk [1] due to found a flaw
in the upstreamed variant. I agree, that this is not ideal, but TL;DR: it less
invasive even to the upstreamed approach and it has no use of any hard coded
numbering schemes. The Galileo Gen 2 is "broken" in an *understandable* way,
i.e. ACPI designers put an absolute GPIO numbers (there are two SoC based GPIO
controllers: SCH and DesignWare which numbers starts at 0) instead of be
relative. For the time being only one device has a driver that needs such GPIO
number, but as I explained in the cover letter, to support it as a quirk I have
to copy ~10% of the existing (in gpiolib-acpi.c) code.

I'm all ears for better approach!
