Well, phandle + line number to be precise. There might be a way to grep
the whole DT and figure out if really we have multiple users for the
same line behind of the phandle.

phandle is pointing to the gpio controller, not to the line.

Ideally yes.

I don't mind this to go away and the first set would configure the level.
Kept it here so I can reuse the gpio-hog code from gpiolib-of ;)

I see, so the gpio-hog might change?

Well. How do we decide which level is the one that should be preserved?

How would the core decide what to in a simplest case:
two device, they are the same part.
ENABLE pin which needs to be high to enable the device.
When the driver probes it asks for initial deasserted GPIO as the device
is not in active use.

We are refcouting low?

Then one device is enabled, it asks for assert for the line.

We are now refcounting high?

Then the other device is also enabled, it also asserts the line.

We are still refcounting high?

_one_ of the device is no longer in use, the driver asks for deassert.

We are switching to refcount low and set the line low?
That would break the other device as it still want the line high.

and no, we can not refcount for the asserted state as if the pin is
RESET and active low, then assert will disable the devices.

Now if you throw in a third device to the mix, the whole global
refcounting will be off even more.

Furthermore:
If you have two different devices one with ENABLE (low=reset,
high=enabled) the other with RESET (low=reset, high=enabled) pin and
they are described in DT correctly and the driver is written correctly
for assert/deassert, then this dummy shared implementation will just
fail as we are sharing the same gpio_desc between them, but they want to
use it with different GPIO_ACTIVE_* level.

I kept it because there were comments for the gpio-shared driver
indicating that in some cases pass-through shared line might be needed
for some setups.

You mean that at every gpio request we would parse the DT to see if
there is another gpio binding pointing to the same gpio pin?
Or want to do a parse for all gpio pins during boot and mark the pins
which have multiple gpio binding pointing to them?

The level that needs to be preserved need to be communicated somehow imho.

If you plan to have separate API for this as I believe you do, then probably

struct gpio_refcount_desc *gpiod_refcounted_get(struct device *dev,
					const char *con_id,
					enum gpiod_flags flags,
					bool i_care_for_asserted_state);

If the device have ENABLE with active high, the driver would:
gpiod_refcounted_get(dev, "enable", GPIOD_OUT_DEASSERTED, true);

if it has RESET with active low, the driver would:
gpiod_refcounted_get(dev, "reset", GPIOD_OUT_ASSERTED, false);

if it is desired that the device would be placed in reset/power-down
when the driver probes.

Then the core would need to figure out what these actually mean at the end.
