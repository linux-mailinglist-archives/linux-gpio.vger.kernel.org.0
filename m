There are other fields that get the container_of() treatment, but node
does look to be the one most used, so probably makes sense to put it
first.

That is what I meant be merging the struct definition with the variable
definition.  Or is there some other way to completely do away with the
struct that I'm missing?

Ok, so any suggestion as to which WARN() variant would make the most sense?
