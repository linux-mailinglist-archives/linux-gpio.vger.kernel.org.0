Agree.
This is only an example to enforcing from the clients which call this 
API. while apparently not all clients ensured this kind of lock safe 
when to call pinctrl_select_state, so that's why placing a lock inside 
pinctrl_select_state to ensure atomic of per dev pinctrl at least.

EXPORT_SYMBOL pinctrl_select_state, let's make it thread safe is a 
motivation here. As above reason explained.

Got you. I haven't seen in-tree console driver have tx path call 
pinctrl_select_state. Will re-vise the commit comments accordingly.
