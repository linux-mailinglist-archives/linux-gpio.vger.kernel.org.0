I've looked at sm6150-usb.dtsi and now I'm completely puzzled by your
answer. The msm-4.14 kernel lists a single USB QMP PHY at 0x88e6000,
used for the primary USB3 host. It it defined as
qcom,usb-ssphy-qmp-usb3-or-dp. Secondary USB host is listed as USB 2.0
only. So what do you mean by the USB3 secondary PHY? Which PHY and which
pins are connected to your video-out board?
