First of all, there is no pre-defined naming convention either for
pins, groups or functions. SCMI firmware can give them any names.

Secondly, What you said in the above is already implemented in
my RFC patch. Please remember the example that I gave:

Given the fact there is no naming convention, we need to explicitly
specify an associated group name in "gpio-ranges-group-names" in any way.

What my driver doesn't care for now is the case where a group of GPIO pins
are multiplexed with other functions (UART, I2C or whatever else).
In this case, we need to configure "pinconf" setup prior to using those
pins as GPIO anyway. Simply, it is out of scope of my driver.
(We can still use existing generic GPIO interfaces to operate them once
set up, though.)

After all, I still believe we need "gpio-ranges" property in most of
all use cases (The only exception is, as I mentioned, to unconditionally
map all pinctrl's pins to GPIO (if possible) when SCMI firmware provides
only GPIO function for all pins. I think it is a simple and yet likely
use case.
