Thanks for testing!

Unfortunatly, I don't have any knowledge what IP core is used in
which SoC. I assumed the lan9668 used the same as the sparx5. If
that is not the case, we need a new compatible. Do you know if it
the same?

On the sparx5 are there any peripheral who you would actually
notice that the timing is off?

That being said, I'd assume all the serial gpio controller has
this "flaw". Simply because a register write won't block until the
value is shifted out to the shift register and actualy loaded by
strobing the load signal. It just depends on your burst setting
(even with bursts off, and clocking all the time) on how large
the delay is. So you might or might not notice it on a board.

Could you also have a look at the other supported sgpio block,
the ocelot and the luton? I don't have any register description
of these.

That fix is at the wrong place. You'd need to fix every gpio user, no?
Instead this tries to fix the controller.
