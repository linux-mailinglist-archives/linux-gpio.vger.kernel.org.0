I won't claim to know for sure either, but I'm trying to follow along,
because we've dealt with various sorts of nasty logical errors in the
gpio and/or irqchip areas here :)

I believe Doug has identified one problem correctly -- that we can't
handle the both-edge toggling entirely after the ack+dispatch.

I believe Jeffy has identified another -- that we can't handle the
both-edge toggling entirely before the ack+dispatch.

This sounds like we need the toggling to happen within the .irq_ack()
callback, in between the ACK and the chain dispatch.

I'm not sure I've fully walked through this yet, but would it suffice to
move the 'toggle_edge_mode' loop into irq_ack(), right after writing the
EOI register? That way we're in one of these cases within irq_ack():

(1) no further edges occurred after the ACK/EIO write: the toggle-loop
will toggle correctly, and then we dispatch the chained handler.

(2) one or more additional edges occurred after the ACK/EIO write
(possibly during the toggle-loop): the loop only exits when we're sure
things have quiesced, so future edges will toggle correctly (i.e.,
polarity is correct). We continue to dispatch the chained handler (which
"handles" all these edge(s)). We may still have leave an IRQ pending (if
many edges happen, racing with the toggle loop) and fire again shortly,
but that's OK.

Does this make sense to anyone else?

I suppose it would be possible to implement the above as a general
irq_gc_ack*() helper, instead of open-coding it, although it might need
the irqchip framework to gain a better understanding of a chip's
polarity register.
