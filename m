Not explicitly.  Andy requested documentation on the pad sizes, which
seemed reasonable, and it also seemed reasonable to me to group them in
the one place rather than repeat the doco for each struct.

But having the size of the pad visible in the struct definition is
preferable, as it is only really relevant to that struct.
And everyone wants to keep the uAPI definitions as short possible, so
will drop these in v2.

Fair enough - bits it is.

Agreed - the reduction in size isn't worth the effort.

No, as I mentioned in the commentary, I'm concerned that I've gone
too small with the padding, so happy to bump that.
And I'm open to suggestions on the other pads as well.
