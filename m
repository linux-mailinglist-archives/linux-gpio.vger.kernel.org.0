You can pass the iomem pointer to the child device, either through the
struct device platform_data void pointer or you can make a wrapper
struct for struct auxiliary_device that the child device/driver, e.g.
pinctrl, would know about. Or you can use a regmap and pass that through
to the function that creates the auxiliary device.

Either way, we don't want the iomem register logic inside a single
driver. Conor recently made that change for mpfs. See this patch[1].

The syscon code uses a regmap so that register access uses a spinlock.
Maybe you need that, or maybe you don't. I don't know. It depends on if
the device has logical drivers that access some shared register. If that
doesn't happen then letting the logical drivers map and access the
registers with iomem accessors is fine. Otherwise, you want some sort of
mediator function, where regmap helps make that easy to provide.

The simple-mfd binding encourages sub-nodes for drivers. This is an
anti-pattern because we want nodes for devices, not drivers. We should
discourage the use of that compatible in my opinion.

I could see the MFD subsystem gaining support for creating child
auxiliary devices for some compatible string node, and passing those
devices a regmap. Maybe that would be preferable to having to pick a
driver subsystem to put the platform driver in. Outside of making a
general purpose framework, you could put the platform driver in
drivers/mfd and have that populate the child devices like clk, reset,
pinctrl, etc.

The overall goal is still the same. Don't make child nodes.
