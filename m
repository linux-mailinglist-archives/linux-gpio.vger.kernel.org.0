Unfortunately what you are describing in the second part is rather
property of the controller which can hog the line, but this is not
what you want in the first part.
The Linux kernel, in many ways, is designed that you need a driver
(I=C2=B2C user space device node is rather a mistake, but compromise for
that time when most of the devices have access from user space
drivers). So, the proper way is to define this as gpio-keys (either
interrupt version or polling one) and connect a listener to the event.

Summarize: you need to describe pin(s) via "gpio-line-names" property
of the controller (it's not so easy task if ACPI tables already have
parts of it, but I think your case should be feasible). And either
provide a gpio-keys device, or use line directly by name as (libgpiod
example):
 gpiodetect
 gpioinfo gpiochipX
 gpiofind $GPIO_LINE_NAME
 gpiomon gpiochipX $(gpiofind $GPIO_LINE_NAME) &

Examples of ACPI are here [1] for controller part (look at the name
list) and for device part [2]. You may look into other folders as
well, though they are not so reach of examples.

Thanks.

Right. ACPI supports properties via _DSD() method.
