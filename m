With all respect to the clever design solutions I would rather go the
de facto Pythonic way. If the native libraries use None for indefinite
then it's better to do that way, otherwise we will add quite a confusion
to the Python users.

The question here is: What in the very same situations are other (presumably
native) Python libraries using?
