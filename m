I'm obviously missing the point here; sorry for being slow.

drivers/gpio/gpio-amd8111.c uses for_each_pci_dev() to look for
PCI_VENDOR_ID_AMD, PCI_DEVICE_ID_AMD_8111_SMBUS [1022:746b] devices.
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-amd756.c claims that same device using the
normal PCI probe mechanism.

In this case both i2c-amd756 and gpio-amd8111 want to use the same
device, so there's at least a reason why gpio-amd8111 uses the
non-standard mechanism.

Your driver looks for PCI_VENDOR_ID_ASMEDIA devices: [1b21:2824],
[1b21:2812], [1b21:2806], [1b21:1824], etc).  But I haven't found a
second driver that needs to claim these devices.

I can't tell what any of these devices are (other than that they seem
to have some GPIO).  You might want to add them to the Linux PCI
database at https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/read/PC/1b21 .  If you do, then
"lspci" will show the correct names for them.

You mention below that these devices are PCIe bridges.  If that's the
case, they would be claimed by the "pcieport" driver in the PCI core
(drivers/pci/pcie/portdrv_pci.c).  If you collect the output of "sudo
lspci -vvxxxx", it would tell us whether the pcieport driver will
claim it.

If it does, then we have a problem because the PCIe port services
(AER, PME, DPC, etc) currently require pcieport.  If you want the AER,
PME, etc functionality in addition to GPIO, then we have to figure out
how to coordinate things.

I'm not familiar with drivers/mfd.  It looks like it might be useful
for cases where a single PCI function implements multiple sorts of
functionality.

But if the problem is that you have a single function that is a PCIe
switch port and also implements some GPIOs, I doubt drivers/mfd will
help.  In that case, both the existing pcieport driver and your new
gpio-asm28xx-18xx driver would need to operate the same function, and
we'd have to make some significant changes to both of them to fit into
the MFD framework.

Long-term, I think it would be good to move the pcieport things
directly into the PCI core instead of being a separate driver.  We've
tripped over this problem before with things like performance counters
in PCIe ports.
