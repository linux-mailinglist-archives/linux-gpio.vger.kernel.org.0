Which is wrong assumption. Software nodes (and firmware nodes) in general
can be shared. Which device pointer you want to add there? Which one
should be next when one of the devices is gone?

No, simply no. Do not use it!

The relationship between device instance(s) and firmware node instance(s)
is m:n, where each of them can be from 0 to ... x or y.

There is no unique mapping between two.
