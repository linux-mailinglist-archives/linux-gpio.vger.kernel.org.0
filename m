Sure, I'm still thinking that having this extra property and explicitly
set it from OF is not that bad :)

>=20

Well the thing is that even if we have pinctrl like for example,
gpio-omap, it is still true that there's no way to get into
'omap_gpio_set_config()' for 'PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_DISABLE' and call
'gpiochip_generic_config()'.

(naturally in this case, one can directly use pinctrl properties to
control the pin but still...)
