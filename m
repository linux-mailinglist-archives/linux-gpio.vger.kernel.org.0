Yes I understand that we need to keep compatibility with the already-defined
compatible.

Indeed it's true that hardware quirks can be applied based on the precise
version read from the register, so I don't think there is a need for overly
precise compatibles.

Since the device-tree binding is currently the same for all versions,
I understand that it makes sense to keep a single compatible (the already
defined one), so I guess I will make another iteration without introducing
new compatibles. But I will probably update the binding document to reflect
which versions are currently known to work with its current state.

Ah good to know thanks, first time hearing about those.
