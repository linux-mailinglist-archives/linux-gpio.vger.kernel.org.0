Assalam alaikum,

I am an active banker,  I saw your email address while browsing
through the bank DTC Screen in my office yesterday. now  I am in a
better position to transfer about $8.3 million US Dollars into a
foreign account. If you are willing and capable to work with me to
receive this fund into a personal or company's account, I will give
you the full detailed information. No risk is involved as it will pass
through normal banking procedures.

Hence, I am inviting you for a business deal where this money can be
transfer to your account which we will shared between us in the ratio
of 50% for me,50% for you and both of us will share any expenses that
will come during the release/transfer from our bank to your bank
account, if you agree to my business proposal. Further details of this
Fund release and transfer will be forwarded to you as soon as I
receive your detail Mail.

1)Your Full Names. (2)Your country. (3)Your Telephone
(4)Your Occupation .(5)Your Age. (6) Your full Address.
I will use these detail information=E2=80=99s to fill a release/transfer an=
d
arrange some documents on your behalf in our bank here as the
beneficiary owner of this fund abandoned in our bank


I want you to reply urgently so I will give you full details on how
this business transaction will be executed. Please listen, this is
real and goes on in Banks all over the world without people knowing.
Let us utilize this opportunity because it does not always come, A lot
of customers open private accounts with different Banks without the
knowledge of their families and when they die, the money will be lost
to the Bank unless someone comes to claim it. This is how a lot of
Bank Directors make so much money silently. Also note I have the
ability to conduct this transaction with total confidentiality with
any company or individual involved, and both of us will share any
expenses that will come during the release/transfer Anticipating your
communication.

Please contact me through my private Email:  alhouttta@gmail.com

All THE BEST Thanks
Alh Idriss Akim Outta
