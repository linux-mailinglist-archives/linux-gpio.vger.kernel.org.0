Again, I said no odd flags for functions, how is anyone supposed to know
what "0" means here?

You just swapped a boolean for a bitmapped flag, right?  That did not
make the api any easier to understand at all.

In the future, please always use BIT() for stuff like this.

Anyway, this isn't ok, do it correctly please, like I asked for the
first time...
