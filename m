You still haven't answered "why", so I can't tell you.

Something like (fix types accordingly to your needs):

static inline u32 sppctl_get_reg_and_offset(unsigned int offset, u32 *roff)
{
              u32 boff =3D offset % 16;
              *roff =3D (offset / 16) * 4;

               return  MY_COOL_MACRO(boff); // BIT(boff +
SPPCTL_GPIO_MASK_SHIFT) | BIT(boff)
}

    reg =3D sppctl_get_reg_and_offset(offset, &reg_off);

You should answer this question, not me.

Actually this is a good catch. Why do you use 0 as a base? In the new
code we are supposed to have -1 to be assigned.

In the enum definition you do something like this (and read documentation):

/**
 * enum ...
 * @pinmux_type_fpmx: fully pin muxing
 * @pinmux_type_grp: group pin muxing
 * ...
 */

There were basically two iterative comments, i.e.
first one suggested adding a check, but second one suggested switching
to kcalloc() API.

But it's not your issue, the kcalloc() does it for you for the good sake.

And if it doesn't, what is the difference?

You are the author of this code, please be prepared to explain every line i=
n it.

You can, but I think it's not needed.
Users may easily get this from other sources. Why do you need to have
such noise in the valuable resource, i.e. kernel message buffer?

These comments are replaced by the kernel doc above, no need to keep them.

Just split it to a few logical parts so that code can be easier to read.
