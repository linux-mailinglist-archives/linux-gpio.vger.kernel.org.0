Ideologically I don't have anything against adding this flag (except
that it should be called BIAS_DISABLE not PULL_DISABLE IMO). Nuno is
right in that the character device is the only way to set this mode
ATM and. However I would like to see the first user added together
with the series because adding features nobody uses in the mainline
kernel tree is generally frowned upon and it's also not clear that
anyone actually wants to use it.
