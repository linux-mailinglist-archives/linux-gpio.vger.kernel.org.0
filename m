That works for me.  Though are chip labels quaranteed unique?

That is exactly the point - the driver has the freedom to do whatever
once .free() is called.  What I am suggesting is that while the user has
the line requested they could set a flag, say via .set_config(), to request
the driver NOT to revert the line, but to leave it as is when freed.
That would stand until the next time the line is requested when the flag
would automatically be cleared.

It would be opt-in, so the driver would not have to support it.
And it could be exposed to userspace via a flag in the uAPI.

Actually you were on the cc list[1], as was I, but it was a pinctrl change
so you probably skimmed over it.
I only looked at it as the bcm caught my eye, and I'm somewhat familiar
with how the Pi devs addressed the gpioset persistence issue downstream.

I wasn't totally comfortable with the change either, certainly not as a
general solution, but it was contained to the module so I didn't object -
I figured either you or Linus would if it bothered you.

Cheers,
Kent.
