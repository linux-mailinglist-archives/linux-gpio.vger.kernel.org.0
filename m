From: Hugo Villeneuve <hvilleneuve@dimonoff.com>

Hello,
this patch series mainly fixes a GPIO regression and improve RS485 flags and
properties detection from DT.

It now also includes various small fixes and improvements that were previously
sent as separate patches, but that made testing everything difficult.

Patch 1 fixes an issue with init of first port during probing.

Patch 2 fixes an issue when debugging IOcontrol register, but it is also
necessary for patch "fix regression with GPIO configuration" to work.

Patch 3 fixes an incorrect label in sc16is7xx_probe() cleanup code.

Patch 4 is a refactor of GPIO registration code in preparation for patch 5.

Patches 5 and 6 fix a GPIO regression by (re)allowing to choose GPIO function
for GPIO pins shared with modem status lines.

Patch 7 fixes a bug with the output value when first setting the GPIO direction.

Patch 8 allows to read common rs485 device-tree flags and properties.

Patch 9 introduces a delay after a reset operation to respect datasheet
timing recommandations.

Patch 10 improves comments about chip variants.

I have tested the changes on a custom board with two SC16IS752 DUART using a
Variscite IMX8MN NANO SOM.

Thank you.

Changes for V3:
- Integrated all patches into single serie to facilitate debugging and tests.
- Reduce number of exported GPIOs depending on new property
  nxp,modem-control-line-ports
- Added additional example in DT bindings

Changes for V4:
- Increase reset post delay to relax scheduler.
- Put comments patches at the end.
- Remove Fixes tag for patch "mark IOCONTROL register as volatile".
- Improve commit messages after reviews.
- Fix coding style issues after reviews.
- Change GPIO registration to always register the maximum number of GPIOs
  supported by the chip, but maks-out GPIOs declared as modem control lines.
- Add patch to refactor GPIO registration.
- Remove patch "serial: sc16is7xx: fix syntax error in comments".
- Remove patch "add dump registers function"

Changes for V5:
- Change patch order to facilitate stable backport(s).
- Change duplicate device addresses in DT binding examples.
- Use GENMASK for bit masks.
- Replace of_property_for_each_u32() with device_property_read_u32_array
- Add "Cc: stable..." tags

Changes for V6:
- Fix compilation bug introduced by patch 3

Changes for V7:
- Minor changes and coding style fixes after review for
  patch 5 "fix regression with GPIO configuration".

Changes for V8:
- Move mctrl_mask to "struct sc16is7xx_port" to avoid compiler warning when
  CONFIG_GPIOLIB is undefined.
- Add "struct device" member to "struct sc16is7xx_port", in order to avoid
  passing a raw "struct device" to called functions from sc16is7xx_probe().
- Add new patch "serial: sc16is7xx: remove obsolete out_thread label"

Hugo Villeneuve (10):
  serial: sc16is7xx: fix broken port 0 uart init
