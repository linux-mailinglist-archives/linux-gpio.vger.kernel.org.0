Ok cool. Our whole suspend/resume and save/restore story hasn't really
been well thought out so we may want to pull all this logic into the
core one day. For now it's OK to do the heavy lifting from provider
drivers until someone gets a better grasp on how this should all work.

Right.

>=20

Sure a WARN_ON() sounds fair. That will not take the whole task down
and makes sure that drivers aren't doing something incorrect. Otherwise,
this looks good and we can optimize by caching the parent index later if
we really need to.
