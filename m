There's 190 GPIOs on SC8180x, but then the math doesn't add up to a
whole number...

SC8180x has the same hardware design.

I added the table in the driver, see sc8180x_pdc_map[], and it has gpio
14 at position 7, with the 14th entry being gpio 38 - which seems like
an unlikely change from the reference schematics.

It does.
