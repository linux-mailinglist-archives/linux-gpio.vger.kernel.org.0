@Konrad, @Bjorn: Can you give any feedback here what's preferable?
Otherwise I'm just blocked on this series.

I get it that you are not final decider for qcom dts changes but it's
quite difficult for someone sending patches to not get any feedback what
other change to replace this is appropriate. I doubt it's a good idea to
just implement some random pm7250-8.dtsi or whatever to potentially
immediately get a response that that way is also bad.

That's why I'm trying to get some info before working on something and
sending it. Hopefully Bjorn or Konrad can add their thoughts above.

Also I don't recall me ever reading a "solution" from your side but
maybe I need to dig through the old emails again.

Luca
