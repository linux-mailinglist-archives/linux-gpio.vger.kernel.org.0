Hi Greg,
will do.

I am confused by your question. I do not understand why the type of
parent matters... And what do you call the parent: s, s->gpio or
s->gpio.parent?

For me, the way I understand it, the only question that matters is how I
can extract the raw device structure pointer from maybe "struct
sc16is7xx_port" or some other structure, and then use it in my
new function...

I should not have put "s->gpio.parent = dev" in the example, I think it
just complexifies things. Lets start over with a more simple example and
only:

    count = device_property_count_u32(dev, ...

With the simplified example, is the following ok:

static int sc16is7xx_setup_gpio_chip(struct sc16is7xx_port *s)
{
    struct device *dev = &s->p[0].port.dev;

    count = device_property_count_u32(dev, ...
    ...
}

If not, please indicate how you would do it with an actual example...

Thank you,
Hugo.
