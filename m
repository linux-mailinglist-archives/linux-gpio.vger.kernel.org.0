That's fine.
My question/idea is simple; how two pinctrl drivers, if possible, be
represented in a single device tree. To allow the case of Peng Fan,
for example, I suppose that we need some DT binding like:

    scmi {
        scmi_pinctrl: protocol@19 {
            compatible = "arm, scmi-pinctrl-generic"; // not sure if needed

            pinmux ... // standard binding
            ...
        }
    }
    scmi_pinctrl_fsl {
        compatible = "fsl,scmi-pinctrl-imx9";

        fsl,pinmux = <&scmi_pinctrl, ...>,
                     <&scmi_pinctrl, ...>;
        ...
    }

"scmi_pinctrl_fsl" driver may reuse generic SCMI pinctrl helper functions,
except dt_node_to_map, in pictrl_ops.
