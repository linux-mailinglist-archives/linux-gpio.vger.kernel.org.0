I'm not sure that the 3 'tiles' means 3 blocks of GPIOs.  Maybe, @Bjorn
can help clarify.  But the ACPI table shows that there is only 'GIO0'
with 'QCOM040D' HID.

Unfortunately, I do not have the access to any sort of these documents.
But I looped in Jeffrey who is part of Qualcomm kernel/firmware team,
and should be able to help clarify GPIO numbering in the ACPI table.
