Yes, and what you are effectively suggesting is: "Technical debt? Oh,
fine, we do not care!" This is not good. I'm in a long term of
cleaning up the dependency hell in the kernel (my main focus is
kernel.h for now) and I am talking from my experience. I do not like
what people are doing in 95% of the code, that's why I really want to
stop the bad practices as soon as possible.

Last to add, but not least is that your code may be used as an example
for others, hence we really have to do our best in order to avoid bad
design, practices, and cargo cults. If this requires more refactoring
of the existing code, then do it sooner than later.

Yes. Is it a problem?

The mess with devm_ vs. non-devm is quite easy to achieve. You are
probably out of the control of what the protocol driver wants to do in
the init. Is the usage of devm (which APIs and in which order can be
used)  WRT SCMI documented somewhere?

Misuse of devm is a common issue, I'm not surprised it will hit your
subsystem one day with such an approach.

P.S. I guess from now on it's your call, but this code and in case
other drivers use similar, is badly written. I hope some documentation
exists to at least justify all this mess and explaining why there no
and (what's really important) will never be a problem.
