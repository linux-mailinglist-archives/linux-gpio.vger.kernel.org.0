No, you will not be sending him -rc1-rc3 stuff at all, that's not how
git works.

Try it yourself and see.  Git does a "what's the changesets that are
in this pull request and not already in mine" when determining this.
You can see it when doing a 'git request-pull', it will only show you
the diff of what will be sent.

Also look at the 'git merge-base' output, it will show the point where
things will start to be sent, and that will not have all of the -rc1
through -rc3 changes in it.

> Greg: Is it too late to have this rebased on top of v6.7-rc1 instead?

Sorry, but yes.  But don't worry, again, git can handle all of this
easily!  Try it locally and see.  Don't fear the 'fast-forward' :)
