Yes and no. Yes, the shift register in this HW is always 'for all'.
No, there are as many shift registers as you have chip selects on the same bus.

Is it a problem? I consider it exactly what it's designed for, it
tells the chip: "hey, there is something for you".

How is CS different in this sense? Just longer? Who cares that it
starts early and latches exactly at the time it must latch the data.

No. I think you missed one little but crucial detail. The strobe is
edge, not level, while you consider CS as a level signal (only).

Right.

So...

See Figure 7 and Table 9 in the datasheet you linked to. When STR is
low, the data is not changed. Maybe it's not clear in this datasheet,
I found somewhere
in a more clear table.

> At least how I see it ...?

If what you are saying is true, the hardware is totally broken and I
wouldn't use it. I.o.w. if the strobe passes all data when it's at low
level and latches at low-to-high, it's broken by definition in my
point of view.
