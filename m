You are referring to the order printed in dmesg. But actually

mmc0 = 0000:00:01.0
mmc1 = 0000:00:01.2
mmc2 = 0000:00:01.3

And this has been so for like 8 years. See f.i. 
https://github.com/edison-fw/meta-intel-edison/issues/135
(this is with Yocto, so using systemd, the issue discussed there is not 
related to this but to card detection iirc)
