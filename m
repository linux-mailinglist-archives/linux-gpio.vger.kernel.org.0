Your use case is totally legitimate I think. An illegitimate case would
be someone modelling the internal enable delay of a regulator controlled
by a GPIO as a GPIO delay instead of using the regulator enable delay DT
property defined by the regulators bindings.

You're right that in cases where there is a single consumer, and the
consumer is well known, and the fact that it doesn't care about rising
time is an intrinsic property of that consumer, then DT should simply
not specify any delay. For more complex cases, I'd say it's likely
overkill to try and design a solution now without real use cases.
