I suspect you are referring to gpiolib here - the mask in gc->get_multiple()
being unsigned long*.

The uAPI that libgpiod uses is limited to 64 lines per request, but that is
only relevant if you want to request more than 64 lines at once from userspace
(you would have to break that into two requests to access all 112 lines).

Note that the mask in gc->get_multiple() is unsigned long*, so it is a
pointer to an array of unsigned long.  Its width is not limited by
unsigned long, but by the bits parameter.  In your case the mask you pass
should contain multiple unsigned longs to achieve 112 bits.
Refer to gpiod_get_array_value_complex() for an example of building bitmap
masks to pass to gc->get_multiple(), in that case via
gpio_chip_get_multiple().

No there isn't, and I can't say I'm a fan of using GPIOs as shared memory,
though it does seems to be a common use case for those accustomed to accessing
hardware registers directly.

I would question whether "much more efficient" is true, as going through all
the gpiolib machinery, including the device driver, to perform the get could
even turn out to be slower than some IPC options - such as actual shared
memory.

Cheers,
Kent.
