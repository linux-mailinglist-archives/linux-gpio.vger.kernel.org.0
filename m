Of course. Unless we were to extend the uAPI to allow that.

This is going to be a pain point - the concept of "used" is getting
muddy.

Say two processes want to get a line.
So both need to request it before they can get it?
Or only one does the request and both can get?

The latter case is painful to use.
The former requires request being idempotent or at least to return an
error that distiguishes a line already held by gpio-manager and a line
already held but not by gpio-manager.

Sure - doesn't mean other tools can't use the DBus API too.
My thinking was existing users of GPIO tools could just add
an option, say -D, to their scripts to switch over to gpio-manager.

Will that support multiple lines, possibly spanning multiple chips?

But that will only return the requests made by gpio-manager, right?

Agreed.  As covered earlier, access control needs to be fleshed out, but
other than that I don't see any obvious deal breakers.

Cheers,
Kent.
