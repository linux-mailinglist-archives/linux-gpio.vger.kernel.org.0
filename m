Assuming the above &scmi_pinctrl refers to the protocol node as we
usually do,  I am a bit puzzled by this example in this RFC series, because
usually in SCMI we DO refer to some resources using the phandle and the
domain IDs as in:

	scmi_sensor: protocol@15 {
		reg = <15>;
		#thermal-sensors-cells = <1>;
	};

	...

	thermal_zones {
		pmic {
			thermal-sensor = <&scmi_sensor 0>;
		};
	};
 
BUT in the SCMI Pinctrl case the current v4 Oleksii series takes advantage
of the existing Pinctrl bindings and naming to describe and refer to
pin/groups/functions, indeed #pinctrl-cells is defined as '0' in the
upcoming SCMI DT protocol node @19 in Oleksii v4, since indeed all the
parsing/matching is done by resource-names following the Picntrl
framework conventions. (AFAIU)

Moreover, due to how the SCMI Pinctrl protocol defines and describes the
pins/groups/functions using a tuple like (<TYPE>, <ID>) , with TYPE
being pin/group/function, a generic binding like the above would have to
be defined by at least 2 cells to be able to identify an SCMI PinCtrl
resource by index. (if that is the aim here...)

Am I right to think that such a generic SCMI PinCtrl binding is still to
be defined somewhere on the SCMI side, if needed as such by this GPIO driver ?

... or I am missing something ?

Thanks,
Cristian
