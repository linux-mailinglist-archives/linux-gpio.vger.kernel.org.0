Yes, and even that member in fwnode is a hack in my opinion. We should not mix
layers and the idea in the future to get rid of the fwnode_handle to be
_embedded_ into struct device. It should be separate entity, and device
instance may use it as a linked list. Currently we have a few problems because
of the this design mistake.

The get_dev_from_fwnode() is used only in devlink and I want to keep it that way.
Nobody else should use it, really.

We can discuss with Saravana, but I don't believe he can convince me otherwise.
