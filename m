I see. MS indeed loves Linux then :-)

You meant "ACPI" -> "DSDT on the certain platform" I hope.

Thank, this makes a lot of sense to me and (unfortunately) I'm familiar with
this concept on some of x86 cheap tablets.

Since the mapping of those wake IRQs is totally platform specific, it needs a
platform driver. On above mentioned x86 platforms we have a one you may take as
an example (good or bad it's another story):
drivers/platform/x86/intel_int0002_vgpio.c.

I think you will need something like this somewhere in ARM platform
infrastructure in the Linux kernel.

That said, I don't see that those numbers are "broken", they have their own
meaning and specific mapping to the real GPIOs and it's so platform specific,
that we can't treat it as a quirk.

Thanks, Jeffrey, it is helpful!
