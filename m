It is the same as yours - just inside out.  i.e. it performs the ops per
selected line, not each op on the whole bitmap of lines.

Yet you argue that bitmaps could be more performant??  Pick a side!

And who was the original author?  I forget.

What you mean to say is it is a pity the reviewers at the time were
satisfied with the code as it stands, right?
Cos there is a process here.
As I recall reviewers were more often than not complaining about
pointless comments, not the lack of comments, so the natural bias as the
author is towards under-documenting...

Let me know if you find a ref to that discussion - I'm curious.
