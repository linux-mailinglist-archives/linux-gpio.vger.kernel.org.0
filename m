Yes, correct, we had the same discussion about i2c.  Again, this is
relatively straightforward when the controller and the device attached
to it (i2c controller/client or gpio controller/function) are both emulated
by qemu, but a lot harder when the controller and device are
implemented in different programs.

I think most importantly we need a DT binding to describe what device
nodes are supposed to look like underneath a virtio-mmio or
virtio-pci device in order for a hypervisor to pass down the
information to a guest OS in a generic way. We can probably borrow
the USB naming, and replace compatible="usbVID,PID" with
compatible="virtioDID", with the device ID in hexadecimal digits,
such as "virtio22" for I2C (virtio device ID 34 == 0x22) if we decide
to have a sub-node under the device, or we just point dev->of_node
of the virtio device to the platform/pci device that is its parent
in Linux.

Adding the Linux guest code to the virtio layer should be fairly
straightforward, and I suppose it could be mostly copied from the
corresponding code that added this for mmc in commit 25185f3f31c9
("mmc: Add SDIO function devicetree subnode parsing") and for USB
in commit 69bec7259853 ("USB: core: let USB device know device
node") and 1a7e3948cb9f ("USB: add device-tree support for
interfaces").
