Oh, is that a thing on newer SoCs? At least in the RK3399 TRM the only 
I/O-domain-related control I can find is the 1.8V/3.0V logic level 
threshold in GRF_IO_VSEL (plus the one outlier in PMUGRF_SOC_CON0).

...which is clearly a property of the regulator, not of its consumers ;)

However it's also not a meaningful state in this context anyway, since 
if the supply was actually off, and thus we were unable to communicate 
with the PMIC to turn it on... oh dear.

Cheers,
Robin.
