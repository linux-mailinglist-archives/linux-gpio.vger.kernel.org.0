Not exactly. On Galileo Gen 2 platform it's broken in understandable way.
In your case it's different and I'm not sure at all that's considered "broken"
in the MS' eyes.

Before any steps further I really want to see more information about that IP
and how firmware applied the numbering scheme.

If it's confidential, you may sent any insights privately.
