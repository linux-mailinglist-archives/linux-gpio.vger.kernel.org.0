So you are adding an interface that nothing will currently use.
Are there plans for hardware that will report the edge, and you are
laying the groundwork here?

Understand, you wont be maintaining this code, even if you intend to.
Consider the poor unfortunate who will have to deal with your code in
the future.  This is not and should not be a minor consideration.

Sometimes long winded comments only add confusion rather than clarity.
If the code alone is confusing and requires more than a line or two of
explanatory comments, excluding function documentation, then you might
want to rethink your code.

In this case the clearest is probably to restructure the if condition as
I suggested and simplify or even drop the comment.

The code here has to deal with the general case, not just the one example
driver you have provided.  So in general there COULD be gaps in the
ts->seq, right?

I do see that using the ts-seq for sw debounced lines is problematic
though. The debouncer itself will be discarding hte events, but that
shouldn't be considered a lost event to the user.  You could track
how many events are discarded by the debouncer and subtract those from
the sequence numbers reported to userspace?

The point I was trying to make there was that, for hte enabled lines, the
sw debouncer should be driven by hte events, not irq events.
That does not imply nor require moving the debouncer to hte.

Can you explain "hte provider will only ts the GPIO line which is
configured as input irq"?  That sounds like a hte concern to me, or even
worse a particular hte provider problem.

The user requests a line with edge event detection enabled and with hte
timestamps.
Nothing in that requires irq from gpiolib-cdev.
gpiolib-cdev should use hte as the event source where it would usually
use irq. If hte requires irq to allow it to generate those events then
hte should be responsible for requesting the irq.
In a hypothetical extreme case where gpiolib-cdev only supported hte
lines there should be no reference to irq in gpiolib-cdev.
Yet you continue to insist that gpiolib-cdev should request the irq for
hte.
What am I missing here?

The set_config does whatever is required to change the line request
config from the old to the new.  Both old and new are complete snapshots
of the line request config.

The change should be seamless except for the attributes being changed.
We certainly do not reset the config and start from scratch - that would
be little better than the user releasing and re-requesting the lines.

For many attributes we can just apply the new config.  But some cases,
such as a change to active low polarity, are a lot more involved.
And if hte considers re-requesting the line to be an error then you
should only make the hte request when the hte flag changes to set.

Kent.
