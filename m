Ok, from the proposed node structure, is it problematic to move the
gpio-controller and -cells in the pinctrl node? And also the pwm-cells
to the pwm node?
This is similar to how it's done by broadcom GPIO MFD [1] that also
expose pinctrl and other device in the same register block as MFD
childs.

This would be the final node block.

                mfd@1fbf0200 {
                        compatible = "airoha,en7581-gpio-mfd";
                        reg = <0x0 0x1fbf0200 0x0 0xc0>;

                        interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
                        interrupts = <GIC_SPI 26 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

                        pio: pinctrl {
                                compatible = "airoha,en7581-pinctrl";

                                gpio-controller;
                                #gpio-cells = <2>;

                                interrupt-controller;
                                #interrupt-cells = <2>;
                        };

                        pwm: pwm {
                                compatible = "airoha,en7581-pwm";

                                #pwm-cells = <3>;
                                status = "disabled";
                        };
                };

I also link the implementation of the MFD driver [2]
