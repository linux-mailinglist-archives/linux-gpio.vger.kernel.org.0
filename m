Hmm... this is interesting. How is the hardware supposed to work if
the user asks for two contradictory levels for two different IRQs?

Missed period.

Ditto.

It's more visible what's going on if you split this to definition and
assignment and move assignment closer to its first user.

This seems redundant, see below.

Is it ever possible? IIRC the IRQ chip code, the set->type won't be
called at all in such a case. Also type is already limited to the
sense mask, no?
