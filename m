That feature is not of our interest (because of having hardware debounce filters) but it would clearly be a very good overall functionality.

Agreed - adding setting only via the SET_CONFIG ioctl is a bit of a
hack, and a v2 of the uAPI is required to add it to the requests, and
to add the debounce value to the info.

Ok, that is widening the scope of the change again, but I'm still willing
to have a go at it.  Wrt a v2, I was considering re-organising how the
flag field works, generally using it to indicate the presence of other
fields in the request, rather than trying to encode a capability just in
the flags.  e.g. direction, drive, bias and debounce would each have a
single flag as well as a field, or fields, containing their actual value.

For requests and sets, the flags indicate the capabilities being
explicitly set.  For info it would indicate the fields populated.

This would simplify and clarify what combinations of flags actually make
sense and what is actually being set or left unchanged.

Polarity (ActiveLow) is a bit different, as it is purely a binary and is
always set, one way or the other, so it could remain just a flag.

If we need to add a new capability then we use the next bit in the flags
and some of the padding reserved for future use for the field(s).

Does that make sense?

I am also wondering if we could merge the handle and event requests by
making edge detection just another capability?  Maybe there is something
I'm missing here.  What was the rationale for them being separate?

Cheers,
Kent.
