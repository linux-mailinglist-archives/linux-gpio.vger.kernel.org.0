Fair enough. I'll use your approach then.

I thought the semantic mix-up was a worthwhile compromise, but
perhaps not. Technically the part that 'interprets' is not the
values themselves, but the index into the values array, which
makes things a bit more confusing. You have to keep in mind how
the registers would behave if you had a single bit, because it's
the bit value that indexes the values array. It's not _that_ hard
to keep straight but obviously... not as obvious. :)
