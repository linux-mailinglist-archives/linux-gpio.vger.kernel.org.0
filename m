Yes, it's a laptop built on Qualcomm Snapdragon SC8180X SoC.  The GPIO
driver is generic for all Snapdragon SoCs, and has been available in
upstream for many years (for DT though). It can be found as the gpio_chip
implementation in MSM pinctrl driver [1].  The SC8180X specific part can
be found as pinctrl-sc8180x.c [2], and it's already working for DT boot.
The only missing piece is to add "QCOM040D" as the acpi_device_id to
support ACPI boot, and it will be submitted after 5.12-rc1 comes out.

Thanks for the pointer to Microsoft document.  On Snapdragon, we have
only one GPIO instance that accommodates all GPIO pins, so I'm not sure
that Microsoft GPIOs mapping layer is relevant here at all.

Please take a look at the GPIO driver, and feel free to let me know if
you need any further information to understand what's going on.
