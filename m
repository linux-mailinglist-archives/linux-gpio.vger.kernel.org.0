Subject: [PATCH v2] dt-bindings: pinctrl: Convert Allwinner Pin Controller to a schema
Date:   Tue, 22 Oct 2019 18:08:06 +0200
Message-Id: <20191022160806.42971-1-mripard@kernel.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.23.0
MIME-Version: 1.0

Sender: linux-gpio-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-gpio.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-gpio@vger.kernel.org

The Allwinner SoCs have a pin controller supported in Linux, with a
matching Device Tree binding.

Now that we have the DT validation in place, let's convert the device tree
bindings for that controller over to a YAML schemas.

Signed-off-by: Maxime Ripard <mripard@kernel.org>

Changes from v1:
  - Add a description for the interrupts
  - Put limits on the number of input-debounce items
  - Remove the vcc-p.-supply type
  - Fix the supplies description

-* Allwinner A1X Pin Controller
-
-The pins controlled by sunXi pin controller are organized in banks,
-each bank has 32 pins.  Each pin has 7 multiplexing functions, with
-the first two functions being GPIO in and out. The configuration on
-the pins includes drive strength and pull-up.
-
-Required properties:
-- compatible: Should be one of the following (depending on your SoC):
-  "allwinner,sun4i-a10-pinctrl"
-  "allwinner,sun5i-a10s-pinctrl"
-  "allwinner,sun5i-a13-pinctrl"
-  "allwinner,sun6i-a31-pinctrl"
-  "allwinner,sun6i-a31s-pinctrl"
-  "allwinner,sun6i-a31-r-pinctrl"
-  "allwinner,sun7i-a20-pinctrl"
-  "allwinner,sun8i-a23-pinctrl"
-  "allwinner,sun8i-a23-r-pinctrl"
-  "allwinner,sun8i-a33-pinctrl"
-  "allwinner,sun9i-a80-pinctrl"
-  "allwinner,sun9i-a80-r-pinctrl"
-  "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-pinctrl"
-  "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-r-pinctrl"

-  "allwinner,sun50i-h6-r-pinctrl"
-  "allwinner,suniv-f1c100s-pinctrl"
-  "nextthing,gr8-pinctrl"
-
-- reg: Should contain the register physical address and length for the
-  pin controller.
-
-- clocks: phandle to the clocks feeding the pin controller:
-  - "apb": the gated APB parent clock
-  - "hosc": the high frequency oscillator in the system
-  - "losc": the low frequency oscillator in the system
-
-Note: For backward compatibility reasons, the hosc and losc clocks are only
-required if you need to use the optional input-debounce property. Any new
-device tree should set them.
-
-Each pin bank, depending on the SoC, can have an associated regulator:
-
-- vcc-pa-supply: for the A10, A20, A31, A31s, A80 and R40 SoCs
-- vcc-pb-supply: for the A31, A31s, A80 and V3s SoCs
-- vcc-pc-supply: for the A10, A20, A31, A31s, A64, A80, H5, R40 and V3s SoCs
-- vcc-pd-supply: for the A23, A31, A31s, A64, A80, A83t, H3, H5 and R40 SoCs
-- vcc-pe-supply: for the A10, A20, A31, A31s, A64, A80, R40 and V3s SoCs
-- vcc-pf-supply: for the A10, A20, A31, A31s, A80, R40 and V3s SoCs
-- vcc-pg-supply: for the A10, A20, A31, A31s, A64, A80, H3, H5, R40 and V3s SoCs
-- vcc-ph-supply: for the A31, A31s and A80 SoCs
-- vcc-pl-supply: for the r-pinctrl of the A64, A80 and A83t SoCs
-- vcc-pm-supply: for the r-pinctrl of the A31, A31s and A80 SoCs
-
-Optional properties:
-  - input-debounce: Array of debouncing periods in microseconds. One period per
-    irq bank found in the controller. 0 if no setup required.
-
-
-Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
-common pinctrl bindings used by client devices.
-
-A pinctrl node should contain at least one subnodes representing the
-pinctrl groups available on the machine. Each subnode will list the
-pins it needs, and how they should be configured, with regard to muxer
-configuration, drive strength and pullups. If one of these options is
-not set, its actual value will be unspecified.
-
-Allwinner A1X Pin Controller supports the generic pin multiplexing and
-configuration bindings. For details on each properties, you can refer to
- ./pinctrl-bindings.txt.
-
-Required sub-node properties:
-  - pins
-  - function
-
-Optional sub-node properties:
-  - bias-disable
-  - bias-pull-up
-  - bias-pull-down
-  - drive-strength
-
-*** Deprecated pin configuration and multiplexing binding
-
-Required subnode-properties:
-
-- allwinner,pins: List of strings containing the pin name.
-- allwinner,function: Function to mux the pins listed above to.
-
-Optional subnode-properties:
-- allwinner,drive: Integer. Represents the current sent to the pin
-    0: 10 mA
-    1: 20 mA
-    2: 30 mA
-    3: 40 mA
-- allwinner,pull: Integer.
-    0: No resistor
-    1: Pull-up resistor
-    2: Pull-down resistor
-
-Examples:
-
-pio: pinctrl@1c20800 {
-	compatible = "allwinner,sun5i-a13-pinctrl";
-	reg = <0x01c20800 0x400>;
-	#address-cells = <1>;
-	#size-cells = <0>;
-
-	uart1_pins_a: uart1@0 {
-		allwinner,pins = "PE10", "PE11";
-		allwinner,function = "uart1";
-		allwinner,drive = <0>;
-		allwinner,pull = <0>;
-	};
-
-	uart1_pins_b: uart1@1 {
-		allwinner,pins = "PG3", "PG4";
-		allwinner,function = "uart1";
-		allwinner,drive = <0>;
-		allwinner,pull = <0>;
-	};
-};
-
-
-GPIO and interrupt controller
------------------------------
-
-This hardware also acts as a GPIO controller and an interrupt
-controller.
-
-Consumers that would want to refer to one or the other (or both)
-should provide through the usual *-gpios and interrupts properties a
-cell with 3 arguments, first the number of the bank, then the pin
-inside that bank, and finally the flags for the GPIO/interrupts.
-
-Example:
-
-xio: gpio@38 {
-	compatible = "nxp,pcf8574a";
-	reg = <0x38>;
-
-	gpio-controller;
-	#gpio-cells = <2>;
-
-	interrupt-parent = <&pio>;
-	interrupts = <6 0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
-	interrupt-controller;
-	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
-};
-
-reg_usb1_vbus: usb1-vbus {
-	compatible = "regulator-fixed";
-	regulator-name = "usb1-vbus";
-	regulator-min-microvolt = <5000000>;
-	regulator-max-microvolt = <5000000>;
-	gpio = <&pio 7 6 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
-};
