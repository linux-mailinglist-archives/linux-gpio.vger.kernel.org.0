It's a part of the so called EG20T PCH. It's part of in particular
Intel Galileo (Quark SoC) and Intel Minnowboard (v1) (Atom E6xx SoC).
Hence the easily found links:

(Chapter 19)

Hmm... Funny, the document #324211 can't be downloaded
https://download.intel.com/embedded/chipsets/datasheet/324211.pdf

I guess you may ping Intel and tell them that they should play nice
when talking about "open hardware" (MinnowBoard initiative).
Nevertheless, the (Old? #457798 is a specification update under NDA.
Okay, it refers to rev 8, while Mouser, see below, provides rev 9)
copy is available on other sites, such as

I'll take from the archives.

Thanks! I look forward to seeing them soon!
