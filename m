I COULD have agreed with this, since AFAIK there is currently an effort to
add support for GPIO on top of SCMI Pinctrl BUT not in Linux, so no reason to
block this series for gpio-related missing features, that should only be additions
not breaking backward compatibility...

....BUT, I've just wrapped my head again around the latest public release
of v3.2 spec (which has gone through so many changes and additions that
I had lost track O_o) AND beside the above mentioned GPIO changes there
are indeed also BREAKING changes around the commands PINCTRL_SETTINGS_GET and
PINCTRL_SETTINGS_CONFIGURE (which were the old PINCTRL_CONFIG_GET/SET),
that now also get/set the selected function: so that, at the end the payload
itself of those commands/replies has also changed IN SIZE, so the driver needs
definitely to be updated (and whatever you use to test on the backend server too,
if you want to test this...)

I think these changes (which I forgot being there) were in since last month, so
already V4 was broken in these regards (which I have not looked at)

I'll leave some comments along the series and test all of this again next week...
...since too many things has changed and I want to re-verify all on my side.

Thanks,
Cristian
