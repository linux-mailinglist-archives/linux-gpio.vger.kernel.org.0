I see it differently. This adds the second variant of how sysfs can be handled
and it needs to be rotten in the same way as the original sysfs. I really don't
see a point to prolonging the life of the broken interface in such a way. If somebody
wants to check the GPIO without accessing character device interface, they probably
are simply lazy to think of how to do that on early stages properly. The desire
sounds like a workaround against proper thinking.

Famous Last Words. How many years the sysfs is being rotten?! This just makes
it a Frankenstein.
