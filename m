Well, that's why the last sentence you quoted is there; but yeah, the
"sub-subsystem" case it only kinda indirectly covered there. I can add
something about it if people feel that this is needed. But in the end
I'd say in this case Bart should be involved or the one that feeds this
to Linus. We'll see soon how both react to your PR. Thx for that BTW!

We get into "best to ask Linus directly" territory here. I suspect
things for him boil down to "a fix is a fix; if it was reviewed and
ideally in next for ~2 days, let's just merge it to get rid of the
regression, unless there are strong reasons to wait a bit more (for
example if the fix is dangerous and better should be in -next somewhat
longer)".

Ciao, Thorsten
