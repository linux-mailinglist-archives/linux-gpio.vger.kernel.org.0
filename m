Hi Bartosz,

We would be only changing the error code here for gpio driver race 
condition.
Anything affected by this patch would have already been broken and might 
be returning
-ENXIO. There is a theoretical chance that a driver exists which uses 
gpiod_to_irq outside of
probe and affected by race condition. The more instructions between 
gpiod_get and gpiod_to_irq
the smaller the chance of hitting the race condition though. Also 
anything hitting the race condition
is broken right now and there hasn't been any issues reported so far. In 
any case that system is not
fixed by this patch, it is still a good idea to apply this patch since 
the proper fix is a lot more
invasive and probably might not be suitable for stable backporting. This 
minimal patch does
not make things worse.

I have sent a v5 for this patch with better commit message.

Thanks,
Shreeya Patel
