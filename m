Hey!

Yes you're missing something important :-P

First of all, the flow all depends on the pinctrl driver "type": we have
the common (v1), moore and paris.
I will leave this research to you, or this reply will become a wall of text,
so let's go on with the latter details, which are relative to the paris one.

You should check pinctrl/mediatek/pinctrl-mt(model).c: here, you declare a
struct mtk_pin_soc containing pointers to pins data and function callbacks,
such as bias_{get,set}_combo() and adv_pull_{set,get}().


Now to the real deal, examples below:

- Declaring property "mediatek,pull-up-adv" means that you get through
   MTK_PIN_CONFIG_PU_ADV case, which calls the adv_pull_set() callback;
- Declaring property "bias-pull-up", however, means that you get through
   PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_PULL_UP, which calls bias_set_combo().

For adv_pull_set() callback being mtk_pinconf_adv_pull_set() the following happens:
- Write to registers PIN_REG_R0, PIN_REG_R1 (set resistor 0,1 en/disabled);
- Write to registers PIN_REG_PUPD (pull up, or down)
- If below writes fail (because no r0r1/pupd declared in your driver's table),
   the code will call the bias_set() callback as a fallback.

For bias_set_combo() cb being mtk_pinconf_bias_set_combo() the following happens:
- Check pull_type mask, it may be one or a combination (OR) of:
   - MTK_PULL_RSEL_TYPE
   - MTK_PULL_PU_PD_TYPE
   - MTK_PULL_PULLSEL_TYPE
   - MTK_PULL_PUPD_R1R0_TYPE
- Call function(s!) mtk_pinconf_bias_set_{rsel,pu_pd,pullsel_pullen,pupd_r1_r0},
   depending on the bits set in the pull_type mask.

All of the aforementioned functions will perform a different register write for
different pullup/pulldown settings..

bias-pull-up:
One of the cases in which you want to use the combo is when you need to set a
combination of, let's say, PULLSEL and R1R0 (enabling a default pull, adding a
series resistance of parallel R1R0 resistors to the default value), which is
similar to RSEL_TYPE, but for SoCs that don't have the RSEL_TYPE register layout.

mediatek,pull-up-adv:
One of the cases in which you want to use the adv_pull_set is when you want to
set *only* R1R0+PUPD or *only* PULLSEL (when r1r0/pupd not supported), but also
*never* modify PU_PD or RSEL registers.


It's a bit tricky to understand, but this stuff is really on a per-SoC basis, as
not all of them will behave like the other... so if you check only pinctrl-paris,
or only pinctrl-mtk-common-v2, you will inevitably go offroad with your research.
The MediaTek pinctrl mutates behavior in a combination of the aforementioned two
*and* the SoC-specific pinctrl data (pinctrl-mt6795.c).

Though, maybe-and-I-say-maybe (because I haven't performed a *full* research on
that topic), it *may be* possible to refactor the mtk pinctrl framework to get
rid of the mediatek,pull-up-adv property and do it all from the standard pinconf
bias-pull-up property instead with some driver magic... but.. in any case, that's
for another time - definitely not now (for me, at least - but if anyone wants to
explore this territory and produce more cleanups, you're encouraged to).


Please note that I tried to simplify the explanation as much as possible and
something inside may have to be "interpreted the right way", when looking for
details that are way more advanced compared to the basics that are explained
here... but you see, it's already a big wall of text... :-) :-)

Cheers,
Angelo
