Then we should try to do this and fix any issues blocking us.

From a fw_devlink perspective, the circular dependency shouldn't be a
problem. It's smart enough to recognize all cycle possibilities (since
6.3) and not enforce ordering between nodes in a cycle.

So, this is really only a matter of pinctrl not trying to do
regulator_get() in its probe function. You need to do the
regulator_get() when the pins that depend on the io-domain are
requested. And if the regulator isn't ready yet, return -EPROBE_DEFER?

Is there something that prevents us from doing that?

So my comment yesterday was that it'd be an overkill to make every
struct pin_desc into a device. But if you can split that rockchip
pinctrl into two devices, that should be okay and definitely not an
overkill.

Maybe something like:

pinctrl {
    compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3568-pinctrl";
    i2c0 {
                /omit-if-no-ref/
                i2c0_xfer: i2c0-xfer {
                        rockchip,pins =3D
                                /* i2c0_scl */
                                <0 RK_PB1 1 &pcfg_pull_none_smt>,
                                /* i2c0_sda */
                                <0 RK_PB2 1 &pcfg_pull_none_smt>;
                };
    }
    ...
    ...
    pinctrl-io {
        compatible =3D "rockchip,rk3568-pinctrl-io";
        pmuio1-supply =3D <&vcc3v3_pmu>;
        cam {
            ....
        }
        ....
        ....
}

So pinctrl will probe successfully and add it's child device
pinctrl-io. i2c0 will probe once pinctrl is available. Then eventually
the regulator will probe. And after all that, pinctrl-io would probe.

This has no cycles and IMHO represents the hardware accurately. You
have a pinctrl block and there's a sub component of it (pinctrl-io)
that works differently and has additional dependencies.

Any thoughts on this?
