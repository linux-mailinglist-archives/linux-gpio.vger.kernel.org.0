Yes, that's exactly the problem. There is a functional dependency in
hardware. This can only be resolved by assuming the hardware is already
correctly configured to access the PMIC.

No, not right. The I2C master indeed does need the IO domain to be
correctly configured and the IO domain can only be configured correctly
when we know the voltage the PMIC supplies to the IO domain.

This works by configuring the IO domain with static values in the
bootloader which knows the reset default PMIC voltage.
