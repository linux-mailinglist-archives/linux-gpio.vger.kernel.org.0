When you are talking about the I2C node that's the bus master for the
PMIC providing the supply, wouldn't it be dependent on "i2c0_xfer"?
And not "cam"?

Otherwise there's a cyclic functional dependency in hardware that can
never be met? Because in that case, your changes would end up
deferring the I2C device probe too.

I'm basically asking to split out the pins that need IO domain to work
into a new subnode "pinctrl-io" of the main "pinctrl" device node.

Right, there can be a cyclic connection dependency in hardware and you
can't define them away. But clearly the I2C master doesn't need the IO
domain to work for the I2C to be initialized, right? Otherwise, how
can the I2C hardware be initialized? It doesn't matter what OS we
have, that hardware can't work. So, what am I missing? We are clearly
not on the same page on some details.
