No global lock is present or needed.  The 'chnls' and 'obsvr' region
registers are indexed by APID.  Both SPMI buses use the same APID
numbering space.  However, that numbering space is segmented, e.g. APID
0-767 corresponds to SPMI0 bus and APID 768-1023 corresponds to SPMI1
bus.  Therefore, there are no circumstances where both buses could be
writing to the same set of registers.

The base and size of these segments is read from registers based upon
the "qcom,bus-id" property values:

Note that the specific register(s) that need to be read differ based on
the bus instance (0 or 1).  The 'base_apid' and 'apid_count' elements
are then used in various callback functions when indexing into regions
with a common numbering space.

Why does the ordering of "reg" entries matter?  "reg-names" defines what
each of the entries corresponds to (independent of the ordering).  Is
there a policy/requirement specified somewhere about the ordering of
"reg" entries when "reg-names" is a required property?

We considered this alternative DT layout when implementing PMIC arbiter
v7 support downstream.  The benefit is allowing common register ranges
to be specified once instead of in both SPMI bus nodes.  However, this
approach has several downsides.

It results in substantially more complex device tree binding
documentation that requires a different layout for SPMI buses for PMIC
arbiter v7 (and above) vs early versions even though support can be
provided with only a minimal modification (i.e. "qcom,bus-id").
Complexity is also increased inside of the spmi-pmic-arb driver.  There,
special data structures and logic would be needed to handle the shared
vs independent register addresses and data.

The SPMI framework currently uses a one-to-one mapping between SPMI
buses and struct device pointers.  This would not work if the new
top-level node represents the true struct device and the per-bus
subnodes are not true devices.  Also, platform_get_resource_byname()
(used in the spmi-pmic-arb probe function) needs a struct
platform_device pointer to read address ranges using "reg" +
"reg-names".  That wouldn't work for the subnodes.

I suppose that "compatible" could be specified for the top-level node
and the per bus subnodes so that all three get probed as struct devices.
 However, that makes things even more complicated and convoluted in the
driver (and DT).

I would prefer to stay with the approach of the two bus instances being
specified independently in DT.

Note that the clk-imx8qxp-lpcg driver has a similar situation where
multiple drivers need to map addresses in the same region.  Commit [1]
documents the requirement.  The details of the problem where
devm_platform_ioremap_resource() cannot be used in place of
devm_ioremap() were discussed in this thread [2].

See above for the code snippet where "qcom,bus-id" is read.
