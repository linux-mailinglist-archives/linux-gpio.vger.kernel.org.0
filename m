From: Thierry Reding <treding@nvidia.com>

Convert the Maxim MAX77620 PMIC device tree bindings from free-form text
format to json-schema.

This also pulls in the GPIO, regulator, pinmux and thermal bindings for
the corresponding subdevices into the top-level binding so that it can
be described more consistently.

-=======================================
-
-Flexible power sequence configurations:
---------------------------------------
-The Flexible Power Sequencer (FPS) allows each regulator to power up under
-hardware or software control. Additionally, each regulator can power on
-independently or among a group of other regulators with an adjustable power-up
-and power-down delays (sequencing). GPIO1, GPIO2, and GPIO3 can be programmed
-to be part of a sequence allowing external regulators to be sequenced along
-with internal regulators. 32KHz clock can be programmed to be part of a
-sequence.
-
-The flexible sequencing structure consists of two hardware enable inputs
-(EN0, EN1), and 3 master sequencing timers called FPS0, FPS1 and FPS2.
-Each master sequencing timer is programmable through its configuration
-register to have a hardware enable source (EN1 or EN2) or a software enable
-source (SW). When enabled/disabled, the master sequencing timer generates
-eight sequencing events on different time periods called slots. The time
-period between each event is programmable within the configuration register.
-Each regulator, GPIO1, GPIO2, GPIO3, and 32KHz clock has a flexible power
-sequence slave register which allows its enable source to be specified as
-a flexible power sequencer timer or a software bit. When a FPS source of
-regulators, GPIOs and clocks specifies the enable source to be a flexible
-power sequencer, the power up and power down delays can be specified in
-the regulators, GPIOs and clocks flexible power sequencer configuration
-registers.
-
-When FPS event cleared (set to LOW), regulators, GPIOs and 32KHz
-clock are set into following state at the sequencing event that
-corresponds to its flexible sequencer configuration register.
-	Sleep state: 			In this state, regulators, GPIOs
-					and 32KHz clock get disabled at
-					the sequencing event.
-	Global Low Power Mode (GLPM):	In this state, regulators are set in
-					low power mode at the sequencing event.
-
-The configuration parameters of FPS is provided through sub-node "fps"
-and their child for FPS specific. The child node name for FPS are "fps0",
-"fps1", and "fps2" for FPS0, FPS1 and FPS2 respectively.
-
-The FPS configurations like FPS source, power up and power down slots for
-regulators, GPIOs and 32kHz clocks are provided in their respective
-configuration nodes which is explained in respective sub-system DT
-binding document.
-
-There is need for different FPS configuration parameters based on system
-state like when system state changed from active to suspend or active to
-power off (shutdown).
-
-Optional properties:
--------------------
--maxim,fps-event-source:		u32, FPS event source like external
-					hardware input to PMIC i.e. EN0, EN1 or
-					software (SW).
-					The macros are defined on
-						dt-bindings/mfd/max77620.h
-					for different control source.
-					- MAX77620_FPS_EVENT_SRC_EN0
-						for hardware input pin EN0.
-					- MAX77620_FPS_EVENT_SRC_EN1
-						for hardware input pin EN1.
-					- MAX77620_FPS_EVENT_SRC_SW
-						for software control.
-
--maxim,shutdown-fps-time-period-us:	u32, FPS time period in microseconds
-					when system enters in to shutdown
-					state.
-
--maxim,suspend-fps-time-period-us:	u32, FPS time period in microseconds
-					when system enters in to suspend state.
-
--maxim,device-state-on-disabled-event:	u32, describe the PMIC state when FPS
-					event cleared (set to LOW) whether it
-					should go to sleep state or low-power
-					state. Following are valid values:
-					- MAX77620_FPS_INACTIVE_STATE_SLEEP
-						to set the PMIC state to sleep.
-					- MAX77620_FPS_INACTIVE_STATE_LOW_POWER
-						to set the PMIC state to low
-						power.
-					Absence of this property or other value
-					will not change device state when FPS
-					event get cleared.
-
-Here supported time periods by device in microseconds are as follows:
-MAX77620 supports 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560 and 5120 microseconds.
-MAX20024 supports 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280 and 2540 microseconds.
-MAX77663 supports 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280 and 2540 microseconds.
-
--maxim,power-ok-control: configure map power ok bit
-			1: Enables POK(Power OK) to control nRST_IO and GPIO1
-			POK function.
-			0: Disables POK control.
-			if property missing, do not configure MPOK bit.
-			If POK mapping is enabled for GPIO1/nRST_IO then,
-			GPIO1/nRST_IO pins are HIGH only if all rails
-			that have POK control enabled are HIGH.
-			If any of the rails goes down(which are enabled for POK
-			control) then, GPIO1/nRST_IO goes LOW.
-			this property is valid for max20024 only.

-- maxim,ramp-rate-setting:		integer, ramp rate(uV/us) setting to be
-					configured to the device.
-					The platform may have different ramp
-					rate than advertised ramp rate if it has
-					design variation from Maxim's
-					recommended. On this case, platform
-					specific ramp rate is used for ramp time
-					calculation and this property is used
-					for device register configurations.
-					The measured ramp rate of platform is
-					provided by the regulator-ramp-delay
-					as described in <devicetree/bindings/
-					regulator/regulator.txt>.
-					Maxim Max77620 supports following ramp
-					delay:
-					  SD: 13.75mV/us, 27.5mV/us, 55mV/us
-					  LDOs: 5mV/us, 100mV/us
-
-Note: If the measured ramp delay is same as advertised ramp delay then it is not
-required to provide the ramp delay with property "maxim,ramp-rate-setting". The
-ramp rate can be provided by the regulator-ramp-delay which will be used for
-ramp time calculation for voltage change as well as for device configuration.
