Could you please turn off HTML message composition. For example your
message completely messed up the quoting in the text above.

uired to *enable* the crash dump / ram dump collection by boot loader when =
qcom_scm.download_mode is set to 1 on IPQ9574 and IPQ5332 SoCs.

Please excuse me, I misread your message, mea culpa. Indeed, they are
not a fix for the existing error...

 into the minidump series. Finally Mukesh again separated out these patches=
