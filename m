Sure there is a bus, every register is on a bus, all these registers are
memory mapped aren't they? "simple-bus" is just a logical grouping, it
doesn't have to imply the bus is physically separate from the rest of
the system bus. If you don't want these misc registers logically grouped
then add them all as subnodes directly on the main SoC bus node.

Calling that group of miscellaneous registers a "simple-mfd" device is
even more incorrectly modeled IMHO.

We have the same problem on our SoCs (hardware folks just love making
miscellaneous junk drawer register spaces :D). And we decided to model
it as a "syscon", "simple-mfd" too, how simple to just have all the
other nodes point to this space with phandles and pull out whatever
register they need. But that was a mistake we are still working to
unwind.

Not to this "system-controller" space you won't. If you keep it as
a "simple-mfd","syscon" you will need to update the binding every
time you add a new node.

Looks better to me, the nodes contain the registers they use which
means you could simply add a ranges property to the parent and
not need to use special accessors and offsets in the drivers too.
