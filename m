That makes sense to me - I also dropped the req_cfg from my examples
as it was redundant.
Why force the user to provide the req_cfg merely to repeat the lines in
the line_cfg?

This is what I meant by giving LineConfig "the line kwarg treatment" in
my original review comments - wherever you were taking 'offset' accept
'line' instead (being a name string or offset int).
It makes the binding more complex as the mapping is deferred, but the
result is more pythonic and consistent wrt line identification across
the API.

OTOH I can understand if you think the API benefits aren't worth the
added internal complexity, which is why I didn't worry too much when you
didn't change it in this version - just thought you decided it wasn't
worth the effort.

Cheers,
Kent.
