This is irrelevant for this discussion. The tegra driver in question
knows which fwnode it's using - the one from the parent device. It's
just that when the HTE driver tries to find the chip using either
gpiochip_find() or gpio_device_find(), it fails and I'm pretty sure
that if Dipen bisected it, it would point to commit daecca4b8433
("gpiolib: Do not alter GPIO chip fwnode member").

IMO the GPIO subsystem should take a phandle to the HTE engine it uses
for timestamping and that would allow us to not do the lookup at all
but that's a different discussion.

Anyway, I think Linus' suggestion is better than this patch.
