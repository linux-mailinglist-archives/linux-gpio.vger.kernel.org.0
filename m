Indeed, so this patch is untested? I doubt the qcom driver is being used
with the one caller of clk_set_duty_cycle() in the kernel.

>=20

I don't like the idea of a WARN or a WARN_ONCE as most likely nobody is
going to read it or do anything about it. Returning an error should be
fine then. If the duty cycle call fails for 50% then that's something we
have to live with.
