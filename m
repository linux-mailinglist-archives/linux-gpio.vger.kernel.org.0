Ok, I understad now.

Yes

Thank you for the answer

I'm curious if he has something specific to Cortex-R to tell.

I've found that Cortex-R82 has a MMU:
https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/cortex-r/cortex-r82
but I can't find any SoC that uses it. Also, I don't know how many 
people could use it honestly.
