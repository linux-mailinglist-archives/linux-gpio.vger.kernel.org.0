Shrug. It's one of the 2 commits mentioned, I don't know which one
exactly. Whichever one changed default behavior from use GPIOs to use
modem ctrl lines.

Reading it again, I *think* this patch is correct. Default behavior is
restored to use GPIOs. The DT property is needed to enable modem ctrl
lines.

What's not okay is just saying, these platforms may or may not need an upda=
te:

    arm64/boot/dts/freescale/fsl-ls1012a-frdm.dts
    mips/boot/dts/ingenic/cu1830-neo.dts
    mips/boot/dts/ingenic/cu1000-neo.dts

You need to figure that out. Have you checked with maintainers of
these boards? When were they added and by who? At the same time or by
the same person would be a good indication the platform uses modem
ctrl lines. Or were these platforms in use before adding modem ctrl
support? Then they probably use GPIOs or nothing.

If there are platforms which would regress if the modem ctrl feature
was just reverted, which ones are those?
