gpiolib-acpi.c already depends on CONFIG_ACPI and is not build when this
is not set. So this does not add any new dependencies. IOW I don't see
the problem here ?

(also for this reason there is no stub for the new
acpi_quirk_skip_gpio_event_handlers() helper)

I don't really see a clean way to move these.

Ok will do.
