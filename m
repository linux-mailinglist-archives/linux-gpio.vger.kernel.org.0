Hi Greg,
normally I would agree, but the refactor in this case helps a lot to
address some issues raised by you and Andy in V7 of this series.

Maybe I could merge it with the actual patch "fix regression with GPIO
configuration"?

It doesn't fix anything, but I tought that I needed this tag since
this patch is a prerequisite for the next patch in the series, which
would be applied to stable kernels. I will remove this tag (assuming
the patch stays as it is, depending on your answer to the above
question).

We already discussed that a lot in previous versions (v7)... I am
trying my best to modify the code to address your concerns, but I am
not fully understanding what you mean about raw devices, and you didn't
answer some of my previous questions/interrogations in v7 about that.

So, in the new function that I
need to implement, sc16is7xx_setup_gpio_chip(), I absolutely need to use
a raw device to read a device tree property and to set
s->gpio.parent:

    count = device_property_count_u32(dev, ...
    ...
    s->gpio.parent = dev;

Do we agree on that?

Then, how do I pass this raw device to the 
device_property_count_u32() function and to the s->gpio.parent
assignment?

Should I modify sc16is7xx_setup_gpio_chip() like so:

    static int sc16is7xx_setup_gpio_chip(struct sc16is7xx_port *s)
    {
	struct device *dev = &s->p[0].port.dev;

        count = device_property_count_u32(dev, ...
        ...
        s->gpio.parent = dev;

?

If not, can you show me how you would like to do it to avoid me trying
to guess?

Thank you,
Hugo.
