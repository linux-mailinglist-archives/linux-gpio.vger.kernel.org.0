Oh, should be read as data-lossleess.

data-lossless, sorry, I was missing that.

Wasn't Rasmus clear about the intention:
1) get rid of active users of bitmap_remap() outside of NUMA;
2) move that APIs to be private for NUMA users exclusively?

Towards that direction is my series.

I'm getting rid of the users of the bitmap_remap() outside of NUMA.
Why should I stop telling that? I think I have to elaborate what
that means.

It's not pos in the sense of what pos means. pos means a position of a single
bit, mask is about many bits. And mask meaning is still the same despite how
we call it, it's bit positions provider, i.e. bits that are set in the mask
will be considered to be worked on. It's mask, why should I rename it?

I see, I should have not used word "simplification" at all.
I will reword to not mention bitmap_remap() _at all_.

No, I won't do that. This is out of the scope as see comment on 3. above.

Why? Is it so complicated?

Let's not make a big deal out of a small typo. I admit that it confused people,
but that was neither in the documentation, nor in the code, just in our
discussion.

Same as for 4. above. I drop the comparison and mentioning of bitmap_remap().
It was a big mistake by me to even mentioned that.
