I'm not adding CC:stable tag for automatic stable backporting. I'm
adding just Fixes tag to indicate that this patch fixes above mentioned
commit.

On Turris Mox board this at least one of those GPIOs available on PIN
header and ready for (GPIO) using. These GPIOs are not specified in
pinmuxing part of Turris Mox dts files included in kernel. But
theoretically they can be added via dts overlay with bootloader.
Probably same applies for Espressobin which also have lot of GPIOs
exported on pin header -- but I have not investigated it.

So I would say currently there is no known or reported breakage and that
is why I have not added CC:stable tag, only Fixes.

Originally I discovered this issue during debugging of U-Boot which has
copy of this driver and U-Boot supports pinmuxing and gpio requesting
via commands. And U-Boot gpio command refused to change status of these
two GPIOs, for explained reasons.
