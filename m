Isn't this a hierarchical irqchip then?

Please consult the following from
Documentation/driver-api/gpio/driver.rst:

---------------------------------

GPIO drivers providing IRQs
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D

It is custom that GPIO drivers (GPIO chips) are also providing interrupts,
most often cascaded off a parent interrupt controller, and in some special
cases the GPIO logic is melded with a SoC's primary interrupt controller.

The IRQ portions of the GPIO block are implemented using an irq_chip, using
the header <linux/irq.h>. So this combined driver is utilizing two sub-
systems simultaneously: gpio and irq.

It is legal for any IRQ consumer to request an IRQ from any irqchip even if=
 it
is a combined GPIO+IRQ driver. The basic premise is that gpio_chip and
irq_chip are orthogonal, and offering their services independent of each
other.

gpiod_to_irq() is just a convenience function to figure out the IRQ for a
certain GPIO line and should not be relied upon to have been called before
the IRQ is used.

Always prepare the hardware and make it ready for action in respective
callbacks from the GPIO and irq_chip APIs. Do not rely on gpiod_to_irq() ha=
ving
been called first.

We can divide GPIO irqchips in two broad categories:

- CASCADED INTERRUPT CHIPS: this means that the GPIO chip has one common
  interrupt output line, which is triggered by any enabled GPIO line on tha=
t
  chip. The interrupt output line will then be routed to an parent interrup=
t
  controller one level up, in the most simple case the systems primary
  interrupt controller. This is modeled by an irqchip that will inspect bit=
s
  inside the GPIO controller to figure out which line fired it. The irqchip
  part of the driver needs to inspect registers to figure this out and it
  will likely also need to acknowledge that it is handling the interrupt
  by clearing some bit (sometime implicitly, by just reading a status
  register) and it will often need to set up the configuration such as
  edge sensitivity (rising or falling edge, or high/low level interrupt for
  example).

- HIERARCHICAL INTERRUPT CHIPS: this means that each GPIO line has a dedica=
ted
  irq line to a parent interrupt controller one level up. There is no need
  to inquire the GPIO hardware to figure out which line has fired, but it
  may still be necessary to acknowledge the interrupt and set up configurat=
ion
  such as edge sensitivity.

---------------------------------

You find an example of a hierarchical GPIO irqchip using the
GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP in drivers/gpio/gpio-ixp4xx.c.
